  <p>The acknowledged value of the figures contained in Drury's "Illustrations,"<a id="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> the extreme rarity of many of the insects figured therein, which
  continue up to the present day to be unique, and the scarcity of the work itself, which appears
  almost unknown to Continental Entomologists, having induced the proprietor of the plates to
  republish the work, I have consented to undertake the charge of bringing it forth in a form more
  adapted to the present greatly advanced state of Entomology. How far I have succeeded must be left
  for the candid Entomologist to decide. It is fit however that, by way of bespeaking indulgence for
  the numerous errors into which I fear that I have, notwithstanding all my care, fallen, I should
  mention the obstacles which have operated against my giving the work that perfect style which I
  could have wished it to possess. Of these the chief difficulty has arisen from the non-possession
  of the specimens which served for the original illustrations, without which it may be readily
  conceived that it has been impossible to ascertain with precision many of the more minute
  characters, of which the present state of the science requires the investigation; thus in many
  cases I have been obliged to remain in ignorance of the particular structure of the antennæ,
  trophi and legs, and the disposition of the veins of the wings, in many of the smaller species of
  Lepidoptera, so that the precise genera may not in some instances be correctly stated; and to many
  I have been compelled to attach marks of interrogation for the like reason. Another and equally
  strong obstacle has been produced from the little attention paid to exotic <span class="pagenum"
  id="pageiv">{iv}</span>Lepidoptera by modern Entomologists. More than two-thirds of these
  Illustrations are illustrative of that beautiful order of insects; and yet, with the exception of
  some of the showy butterflies and moths, scarcely a reference is to be found even in the works of
  Fabricius, the personal friend of Drury, whose Entomologia Systematica, published in 1793 and
  1794, contains the last general summary of the species of this order; Gmelin also, whose Systema
  Naturæ it has been the fashion to decry, but which, as a laborious compilation from the works of
  preceding and chiefly Continental authors, is of great service,<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> was only acquainted with these illustrations through the early
  works of Fabricius.<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> It is true that M. M. Boisduval
  and Guérin have respectively published various new exotic Lepidoptera, especially of the Nocturnal
  group, in the Voyages of the Coquille and Astrolabe; but we still want a general revision, not
  only of the species but of the genera of this order. It was to have been hoped that, as regarded
  the Javanese species, this would have been effected by Dr. Horsfield, whose work upon the
  Lepidoptera of Java, as far as published, leaves nothing to be desired of the structural details
  of the species illustrated therein. M. Boisduval also, in his Histoire Naturelle des Lépidoptères,
  has treated the subject in a masterly manner, availing himself both of the preparatory states and
  veining of the wings; but we greatly miss those beautiful details which render the works of
  Horsfield and Curtis invaluable. It is in this comparative ignorance, both of the structural and
  metamorphotic details of exotic Lepidoptera, that we may attribute the want of a sound and
  philosophical distribution of the order in question; and which at the same time prevents us from
  determining the situation of many remarkable and anomalous groups. Of these the genera Castnia,
  Urania, &amp;c. and the whole tribe of the Zygænidæ may especially be mentioned; and it is with
  the view of inciting enquiry into this part of the subject, that I have introduced many of the
  latter species into the genus Callimorpha amongst the Nocturnal moths.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Another obstacle has been produced by the little attention paid by the
  Entomologists of the last century to the geographical situation of their insects; as an instance
  of this, it will be sufficient to mention that Linnæus and Fabricius made use of the term "In
  Indiis" generally, to indicate that an insect was an inhabitant either of the West or East Indies.
  Drury indeed appears to have paid more than the ordinary degree of attention to this part of the
  subject, as appears from the Catalogue of his Insects, which I obtained at the sale of Mr.
  Donovan's collections, to whom, as appears by a note, they were presented by Mr. Drury. Thus under
  Lucanus interruptus, (Genus Passalus, Fabricius,) we find the <span class="pagenum"

  <p>Here it is quite evident that Drury had carefully noted down the localities of all the
  specimens of this insect which he possessed, and which are now described as distinct species; and
  this extract will I think be quite sufficient to shew, that from the careful manner in which these
  Catalogues were kept by Mr. Drury, we are entitled to regard them, when there happens to be a
  difference between the works of Drury and Fabricius, Linnæus, &amp;c. as at least of equal
  authority with the writings of these authors. I regret that these Catalogues did not come into my
  hands until after the first and second volumes of this edition were printed off. I have
  incorporated the notes in the third volume; and have given, as an Appendix, extracts from these
  Catalogues, where there happens to be any variation or doubt as to the locality of any of the
  species figured in the first two volumes.</p>

  <p>I have almost invariably adopted the very proper principle of referring to that name, either
  generic or specific, which has the priority in point of date. In the first edition, the first
  volume appeared without specific names, which were at that time a novelty but recently introduced
  by Linnæus. In the second volume, however, an appendix was given, containing specific names both
  of the first and second volumes, and a similar appendix was given at the end of the third volume;
  but no specific names appeared in the body of the work. To many of the names contained in the
  appendices Fabricius referred, many he entirely omitted, and for many he substituted others. These
  last I have of course rejected; and have in many instances given the dates when the names were
  first imposed by the different authors&mdash;a plan which would be very serviceable if generally
  adopted. I have, likewise, made a point in many cases of restoring the specific <i>proper</i>
  names, where, in consequence of a change in the sex of the generic name, a corresponding change
  had been made in such specific name. This alteration had been carried to a great extent in the
  Encyclopédie Méthodique; and many male and female <i>proper</i> names had been completely altered,
  in order to suit them to the sex of the new genera in which they were placed. This was, however,
  an error on the wrong side; because it is admitted as an established principle, that if it should
  be thought necessary to subdivide a genus, the names of the subdivisions should be of the sex of
  the original generic name.</p>

  <p>The plan upon which the first edition of this work was published may be seen from the following
  specimen, which is one of the shortest given, but which will be sufficient to shew not only the
  style of the former edition, but also the manner in which I have treated the subject and the
  additions which I have introduced.</p>

  <p>The name of Papilio Eumeus was consequently proposed for this insect in the Appendix to the
  second volume.</p>

  <p>Amongst the manuscripts with which I have been favoured by the relatives of Mr. Drury, or have
  obtained elsewhere, are comprised a variety of notes relative to the publication of this work, and
  of observations from which the following are selected. He notices that "his <i>descriptions</i>
  are only intended to assist the reader in ascertaining the different species; and that they are
  not intended to be so complete as to give a perfect idea of the animal without the help of the
  figure." He alludes to the difficulty not only "of ascertaining true colours or calling them by
  their proper names," but also of "colouring the prints so, as to exactly represent the natural
  specimens,"&mdash;that he has mentioned and given English names to no more parts of insects than
  had suited his purpose for describing them,&mdash;that "there are some parts mentioned in the
  descriptions which cannot be seen in the plates, such as the Gorget (Sternum), &amp;c. which may
  serve not only to assist in classing them, but to ascertain their species." "The descriptions of
  the Hymenoptera are not intended to be so complete as to give a perfect idea of the insect, but
  are only given to assist the reader in observing the figures."</p>

  <p>"All the descriptions are taken from the insects themselves; whatever defects, therefore, are
  to be observed in comparing them with the coloured figures must be imputed to the artist, as it
  would not be proper to describe them according to the prints, but to <span class="pagenum"

  careful to omit nothing of the original edition in this edition of the least importance, but have
  given the description as much as possible in the words of the author himself.</p>

  <p>I have also added a general Systematic Index to the entire work, and an Alphabetic Index, in
  which the names employed in the first edition are distinguished by an asterisk.</p>

  <p>The collection formed by Drury was exceedingly choice, and had occupied nearly thirty years in
  its formation; for although, as Drury himself says (in one of the printed circulars which he
  distributed with a view to its sale) "there may be in Holland collections more numerous, having in
  many instances a great number of a single species, yet no collection abounds with such a wonderful
  variety in all the different genera as this. All the specimens of which it is composed, are in the
  highest and most exquisite state of preservation, such an extensive collection can be supposed to
  be, and a very considerable number are <i>unique</i>, such as are not to be found in any other
  Cabinet whatever, and of considerable value; many of which, coming from countries exceedingly
  unhealthy, where the collectors, in procuring them, have perished by the severity of the climate,
  give but little room to expect any duplicate will ever be obtained during the present age; and the
  learned quotations that have been taken from it by those celebrated authors Linnæus and Fabricius,
  in all their late editions, are incontestable proofs of the high degrees of estimation they
  entertained of it."</p>

  <p class="sp3">This statement was made in 1788, when the author had consumed upwards of
  twenty-five years in its formation, and at which period no less a sum than £4,000. had been
  expended upon the collection. At this period the collection consisted of&mdash;</p>

  <p>Subsequently great additions were made to the collection, which, as will be seen from the
  localities affixed to the species figured in these Illustrations was received from all parts of
  the world with which England at that period had intercourse. Of the earnest zeal with which this
  collection was made, an idea may be obtained from a copy of a letter addressed to a gentleman
  residing in Africa, with whom he was anxious to enter into correspondence.</p>

    <p><span class="gap" style="width:2em">&nbsp;</span><span class="sc">Sir</span>,</p>
    <p>My being an utter stranger to you compels me to apologize for the liberty I take in sending
    you this. Mr. Carghill's recommendation is the occasion of my doing so, and he has assured me of
    your <span class="pagenum" id="pageviii">{viii}</span>kind disposition to oblige me in those
    articles that are the subject of the following lines; I must therefore inform you that I am
    engaged in the study of Natural History, but as the extensiveness of it in all its several parts
    is very great, I confine myself entirely to one single branch, and that is Insects. A branch I
    find fully sufficient to engage my attention without entering into any of the others, and in
    consequence of this I am endeavouring to obtain as large a collection of foreign ones as I
    possibly can; to this end I am under a necessity of getting various recommendations from my
    friends to gentlemen settled in foreign parts, who I must consider as the only persons that can
    effectually assist me in this scheme. Permit me therefore, Sir, to beg your concurrence herein,
    and if the highest ideas of gratitude can prompt a man to make an adequate return for any favour
    of this kind, be assured I shall take the earliest opportunity of manifesting mine for any thing
    you shall think proper to oblige me with. The great distance the continent of Africa is situated
    from London, the ignorance we labour under of its produce in the insect world, and the great
    difficulty I have found in procuring any insects from those parts, are circumstances that rather
    increase than blunt my desire for them; but as in the course of fourteen years I have not been
    able to procure any great number, I can only attribute this disappointment to my having never
    been able to apply to any gentleman settled there, for the persons that I have hitherto
    commissioned to this purpose were those that returned with the ships they went in, and I imagine
    their time was too short to be able to procure such things for me; but as Mr. Carghill has
    informed me your residence in Africa will afford you many leisure hours, permit me to indulge
    the hope of your complying with this request. It is necessary for me to inform you that there is
    no occasion for your bestowing any time of your own in this pursuit, as I imagine it might be
    done by people to be hired in Africa to that purpose for a very trifle; and as it is necessary I
    should inform you where and in what manner insects in general are to be taken, give me leave
    therefore to explain the use of the things I have sent for that purpose: you will observe the
    bows of the forceps being covered with gauze, and folding so close together as to prevent any
    small insect's getting out when once enclosed, constitutes a contrivance the best adapted of any
    thing I ever saw for that purpose, it is small enough to be carried in the pocket, and if you
    have curiosity enough to employ an hour in this amusement, permit me to say you will have a
    scene of wonders opened to you in the insect world, you will have such a number of objects of
    speculation present themselves, that will amaze you. When an insect is inclosed in these nets it
    is to be stuck through the body with a pin (I have sent some for this purpose), and in that
    manner placed in the box, whose top and bottom are lined with cork. Suffer me to beg of you (if
    you will be so obliging to procure me some of those things) to get a larger box made in Africa
    of soft wood, in which a pin will easily enter, and replace the insects out of the oval box now
    sent into that, and when filled I will entreat you to commit it to the care of a friend to be
    conveyed to England, giving him at the same time a charge to keep it from being tumbled about by
    the rolling of the ship, which will certainly damage the contents, and favouring me with a
    letter of advice; it is necessary to beg you to paste a slip of fine linen or paper all round
    the crevice and opening of the box, to prevent the cockroaches, ants, &amp;c. getting in, who
    will infallibly damage and destroy the insects in it; I forgot to mention that they should not
    be removed out of the oval box into the great one till they are dead, because they will scratch
    and tear one another to pieces, therefore when the person comes home from collecting, they may
    be taken out singly and stuck on a piece of board or stick, and held close to the fire (not so
    as to burn or scorch them), and this in less than a minute will effectually kill them,
    afterwards they may be stuck very close together in the large box, and in that manner sent to
    England. I will just mention what kinds will be most acceptable, and where they are to be found,
    viz. beetles or insects with hard cased wings, insects with transparent wings, such as wasps,
    <span class="pagenum" id="pageix">{ix}</span>bees, waterflies, also locusts or grasshoppers,
    ants, fireflies, or in short any kind except cockroaches, centipedes, or scorpions, which in
    general are so very common they cease to be valuable&mdash;of all the other kinds there is an
    infinite variety, differing in size, shape, and colour, any of which will be very acceptable,
    either large or small; and of which, give me leave to observe, the most ugly disagreeable
    insects (as they appear to be) are the most desirable. They are found in various places, some on
    flowers, some in horse-dung or cow-dung, some under stones and logs of wood, some under the bark
    of trees where it separates or divides itself from the body, which by tearing up will expose
    many kinds to view; but no place abounds more than rotten trees, for there they hide and secrete
    themselves in holes among the rotten wood, and are never seen unless they are searched for. Let
    me here observe, that the different seasons will yield different species of insects, some being
    to be found in one week that were not to be seen the preceding ones, and the next will afford
    others differing from the former, while the succeeding one shall produce some other sorts that
    were not to be seen before; so that by searching for them at different times, you perceive great
    varieties will be collected. I must also beg you to preserve the horns of them as much as
    possible, as they in a great measure determine their genus, and as such should not be broke off.
    The insects placed in the box will serve as samples to show the person you may hire what kinds
    of things are meant to be collected, who for want of them might not be able to understand your
    instructions.</p>
    <p>I have now, Sir, mentioned every article necessary to be known, therefore shall conclude with
    once more begging you to assist me in this scheme; and if there is any business, or any other
    thing, in which I can be serviceable to you here, I beg you would command me; but if there is
    nothing of that kind by which I can express my gratitude, permit me again to repeat I shall take
    the first opportunity of making a return fully adequate to your favour.</p>

  <p>The total amount obtained for the Insects was £614. 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and about £300. more
  for the Cabinets, Books, &amp;c. with the Copper-plates of the Illustrations.</p>

  <p>Of the estimation in which the works and collections of Drury were held by Linnæus, Fabricius,
  &amp;c. the constant references (especially by the latter) made to them, will sufficiently prove.
  The former dedicated a fine species of Cimex to Drury, figured in the first volume of these
  Illustrations, pl. <a href="#plate42">42</a>. f. 1. 5.; whilst the latter described an American
  species of Stenocorus from Drury's collection, under the name of St. Drurii (Ent. Syst. 1. 2. p.
  302.) and also a Danish Tinea under the name of T. Drurella. The Rev. W. Kirby also in his
  Monograph upon the English Bees, has named a rare species belonging to the modern genus Eucera,
  Apis Drurella, with the remark&mdash;"In honorem D. Drury, operis entomologici splendidissimi
  auctoris, cujus museum insectorum rarissimorum undique conquisitorum gazophylacium ditissimum,
  hanc apem ab illo acceptam nominavi." (Mon. Ap. Angl. 2. p. 286.)</p>

  <p>That Drury was in correspondence with these "Heroes Scientiæ" will therefore be unquestioned;
  and the following letter from the younger Linnæus, communicated to me by the relatives of the
  former is interesting not only on this account, but for the curious statement relative to the
  &#x0152;strus humanus then recently discovered in South America.</p>

    <p class="sp0">To Mr. D. Drury, Goldsmith in the Strand, in London.</p>
  </div>

  <p>My late friend A. H. Haworth, Esq. thus spoke of Drury and his works in the year 1807. "In the
  year 1770 we arrive at the time of publication of a beautiful work on Entomology, that of my late
  and regretted friend D. Drury, F.L.S. in one vol. 4to. printed at London, and containing
  comprehensive descriptions in English and French, with an Index of Linnæan names at the end, and a
  great many coloured copper-plates of such interesting exotic Insects, as had not been before or
  insufficiently figured. The icons were executed by Moses Harris, in his best style; and are far
  superior to any of their predecessors in Britain.</p>

  <p>"It is also unquestionably the first work in this country in which the trivial names of Linnæus
  are suffered to make their appearance, and although only given in the shape of an index, their
  extensive value throws a lustre on the utility of the work, which, unaided by them, would not have
  reached a second volume, published in 1773, and a third in 1782; and even a fourth would have
  appeared if the author had lived much longer;<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> as he
  himself assured me, some time prior to his decease; wherein would have been delineated some of the
  gigantic and extraordinary insects of Demerara, in which remote territory he had successfully
  employed a collecting agent. Mr. Drury's Cabinet was one of the most extensive ever made; and is
  said to have contained, in species and varieties, the surprising number of 11,000 insects. He
  spared neither pains nor cost in getting them together, and like Petiver of old, sent printed
  instructions, in various languages, all over the world for that purpose, by captains of ships and
  others.</p>

  <p>"Soon after his decease, at an advanced age, which happened about two years since, his valuable
  collection was disposed of in London, by public auction."&mdash;(Trans. Ent. Soc. Vol. I. 1807. p.
  34.)</p>

  <p>The decease of Mr. Dru Drury occurred on the 15th of January, 1804, at the age of eighty, and
  he was buried at the parish church of St. Martins in the Fields.</p>

  <p>It is universally allowed that the study of nature is one of the most pleasing employments that
  can engage the mind of man. The entertainment it affords is as infinite as the variety of subjects
  of which it is composed; and such a vast field of speculation lies open to our view, either in the
  animal, vegetable, or mineral worlds, that each of them is fully sufficient to engross the
  attention of a single person. It must be allowed, that the study of natural history is so far from
  having attained that degree of perfection it might have done, by the assiduity of the curious,
  that it cannot, at present, be considered as having attained its meridian; and the slow manner in
  which it arrived even to that, has subjected us very much to the reflections of foreigners; many
  of whom appear surprised, that a nation, not inferior to others in every branch of science and
  knowledge, should discover so great a want of curiosity, and little attention to a study that has
  been productive of so many advantages to mankind, and probably, may hereafter produce many more.
  Certainly, such opportunities for improvement never presented themselves in this kingdom, as in
  the present age. All corners of the world are visited by our ships; the remotest shores of Europe,
  Asia, Africa, and America, are not unknown to our countrymen; but feel the effects of that
  insatiable thirst for traffic and gain, that animates the present generation. Every lover,
  therefore, of this study must naturally hope, that such noble occasions of increasing the
  knowledge of nature, may not be neglected. It is indeed true, that the number of its votaries, in
  England, are but few, in proportion to other states, where professorships and societies are
  established under the patronage and protection of the chief personages: yet if we consider it as
  affording an inconceivable fund of entertainment to its followers, it is rather to be wondered it
  is not more encouraged and propagated among us, than that we should find a few who have resolution
  enough to judge for themselves, and follow a study that is always new and always pleasing. The
  sneers and contempt thrown on it by men of narrow minds, who are impatient at hearing of persons
  bestowing their time in collecting a plant, an insect, or a stone, may perhaps contribute <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagexiii">{xiii}</span>not a little to prevent its progress; but whatever
  character may be stamped, either upon the study, or its professors, by such persons; it is
  certain, none but men fit to be placed in the first rank, have usually philosophy enough to prompt
  them to make enquiries into the works of nature. To some the task appears too arduous, to others
  too intricate, and to the generality too trifling; who are apt to look with contempt on every
  pursuit that does not coincide with their own opinions; nor must we, from vulgar minds, expect any
  conclusions in its favour: with these, a horse, a dog, or a cock, seem to bound the utmost limits
  of their gratifications. But men of refined tastes will judge otherways. They know that the
  inexhaustible store of entertainment nature affords in the contemplation of her works, is
  unbounded. It is not to be enjoyed all at once; the more we pursue, the more we shall possess, in
  proportion as we manifest a greater or less ardour. Nor is the serene placid enjoyment found
  therein, to be measured by the common gratifications of sense; as these often leave stings behind
  that worry the soul, and subvert the end they intended to promote; while the other offers to us
  its friendly aid, replete with happiness, health, and peace. And further, if the contemplation of
  the works of the Sovereign Architect, tends to promote that serious and attentive state of mind
  which disposes men to the pursuit of virtue, in order to be happy; and if the knowledge and
  practice of virtue are the means of supporting the mind through all the difficult passages and
  rugged paths of life; the naturalist bids as fair to be happy as any of the human race. His
  pleasures are not chequered by remorse, or damped by despair; his pursuits leave no horrors on the
  mind, or clash with the duty he owes his Maker, his neighbour, or his prince; his conscience
  suffers not for the indulgence of his mind, nor has repentance need to stalk behind him with an
  uplifted arm, for injustice committed on his fellow-creatures; on the contrary, it is for them
  ultimately his labours are pursued, for them he inquires into the various arcana of nature; every
  part of the earth is searched for their benefit, and its bowels are torn out and examined for
  their advantage.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if we consider natural history as connected with religion, we shall find
  them so interwoven and blended together as not to be separated. In this view we shall find it the
  best adapted for opening the mind, enlarging its conceptions, and giving us the most exalted ideas
  of the Deity, of any science whatever, astronomy not excepted, whose study, however noble it may
  be thought, tends not more to the same improvement; for certainly the power, wisdom, and goodness
  of the Almighty are as conspicuous in the smallest objects, as those of the first magnitude, if
  <i>great</i> and <i>little</i> be only relative terms. If, therefore, natural history is able to
  accomplish this, nothing surely can afford a more effectual cure for infidelity. For whoever heard
  of a naturalist being an atheist? or of an infidel, who had spent his life in studying and
  observing the works of nature? I believe none will hesitate to pronounce the man, who has made any
  considerable progress in this study, and who could entertain thoughts so injurious to the honour
  of his Maker, to be a more wonderful being than any that ever went before him.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexiv">{xiv}</span></div>

  <p>The train of reflections that arise from these considerations, is greater than is consistent
  with the plan I have prescribed to myself in these pages. If the reader is desirous of being
  further informed of the uses and advantages of natural history, I shall refer him to
  Stillingfleet's Tracts, taken from the Am&#x0153;nitates Academicæ, published at Upsal; where he
  may be acquainted with many curious and interesting particulars, which I have not room to insert
  here; my speculations having been confined to one single branch (insects) I shall only mention
  such observations relative thereto as may be proper for an introduction of this kind.</p>

  <p>Insects may, with great truth, be considered as a rank of beings so wonderful and
  extraordinary, as to strike with astonishment every observer, if we regard either their structure,
  powers, or use; and creatures, who, at the same time that they challenge our regard, loudly
  proclaim the wisdom, goodness, and omnipotence of their great Creator. If their shape and beauty
  are capable of attracting our notice, their ways of living are no less adapted for exciting our
  admiration; and the more we enquire into their nature and history, the more occasion we shall find
  for confessing this great truth, "nothing is created in vain." The wondrous manner in which
  numbers of them pass their lives, during their first states, is unknown to the greater part of
  mankind. Most people, indeed, know that a Caterpillar produces a Butterfly; but thousands of
  persons do not know that a Caterpillar is a Butterfly in disguise, as Dr. Lister ingeniously
  observes,<a id="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and as Swammerdam<a id="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> proved to the great Duke of Tuscany, by stripping off the external
  skins, and displaying the butterfly concealed beneath them. Many persons are ignorant that plants
  (even of the most poisonous nature) are the beloved and favourite food of some species of insects,
  and that what is wholesome and nourishing to one, is pernicious and destructive to another. Who
  would believe that the hard substance of the soundest Oak was capable of being macerated by an
  insect, and received into its stomach as food? that it should there yield a proper nutriment for
  its growth, and that nothing but a substance as hard and firm as that could possibly contribute to
  the creature's health and increase? Who would imagine that a colony of Ants, an insect so
  contemptible in size, considered singly, were capable of making animals, of considerable bulk and
  strength, retreat from them as from a formidable enemy?<a id="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Who would suspect that numbers of insects are appointed to live,
  during the greatest part of their lives, within the bodies of other animals, many of whom receive
  no material injury thereby; some become frantic and <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexv">{xv}</span>diseased, and others are doomed to perish, and by their deaths give birth
  to these their inbred enemies? Who, that is a stranger to natural history, would believe that
  there are insects destined to live in the waters many months, where their principal employment is
  the destruction of animals less than themselves, on whom they feed and thrive, till they become
  inhabitants of the air, when their lives are terminated in a few weeks, perishing by the
  depredations of old age, if they are lucky enough to escape the power of other animals stronger
  than themselves? Yet such are the truths existing in nature; truths known to every one conversant
  with this study. In short, there is no part of the kingdom of nature, where so many wonders are
  unfolded to us, as in this of insects.</p>

  <p>Nor are they to be considered in that contemptible light in which the generality of mankind are
  apt to place them. We are too prone to think every thing noxious and unnecessary, if we are not
  fully acquainted with its use. "The poor Beetle that we tread on," serves to fill up an order of
  beings, as useful and proper in the economy of nature, as that of a partridge or a hare, whose
  preservation and increase we are so solicitous for. Many others, whose very sight create the most
  disagreeable sensations, are not less useful and proper, under the same predicament. The carcases
  of dead animals, which, when putrid, send forth a most nauseous stench, would remain so for a
  great length of time, were it not for the various kinds of Flesh Flies, who, by depositing their
  eggs there, help to consume it very quickly, and prevent a continuance so offensive to our
  nostrils and health. Many kinds of insects are to be found here in England, in great plenty, who,
  it is highly probable, by a close enquiry into their natures might be rendered very serviceable to
  us, either mediately or immediately. The blue Dung Beetle (Scarabæus Stercorarius of Linnæus)
  found in great plenty in July, under horse-dung and cow-dung, it is not unlikely may yield
  effects, either in medicine or dyeing, that at present we are ignorant of. It is certain, it
  abounds with salts that are strong and pungent; but the examination of them must be left to time,
  and the enquiry of some ingenious person.</p>

  <p>The Meloe Proscarebeus of Linnæus, or English Oil Beetle, described by Moffat, lib. i. cap.
  23., also by Godartius in Lister's translation, number 120. yields an oil by expression in
  considerable quantity, which is used in Sweden, with the greatest success, in the cure of the
  rheumatism, by bathing the afflicted part. Of this I have been well assured by an ingenious
  physician who resided there. Might not the same effects be expected from it here as there? Its
  virtues, I imagine, are not confined to a single country; nor can I suppose the different
  situations of them will prevent its being equally efficacious here as in Sweden. However, it is
  certainly worth while to make the experiment.<a id="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexvi">{xvi}</span></div>

  <p>The Cantharides or Spanish Flies, is a species of insect every one has heard of. They are
  brought us from abroad, and used medicinally; but principally to raise blisters. For these we pay
  great sums of money to foreign countries: but a proper examination into the nature of insects
  might save us the necessity of doing so; for let me not be disbelieved, when I say this very
  species of the cantharides is found in England.<a id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
  Might not, therefore, a close inquiry into the subject, spare us the trouble and expense of
  applying to foreigners for this article? But are the medicinal virtues of the cantharides confined
  entirely to that species? Is there none other found in England, answering the same purpose, which
  we might have by seeking for? If I am not mis-informed, there is. The Musk Beetle, or Cerambix
  Moschata of Linnæus, is found on the bodies of willow-trees in the month of July, or sooner, if
  the weather is favourable. This insect, I have been confidently informed by an eminent surgeon
  (the late Mr. Guy) who tried it, has the same virtues, and produces the same effects as the
  cantharides; being capable, when properly prepared, of procuring a strong blister in as short a
  space of time as the other. Whether there is not other insects to be found in this kingdom, whose
  properties, when examined, might be found similar to the cantharides, is a matter that time only
  will clear up.</p>

  <p>I cannot here pass unmentioned the effects of ants, whose volatile effluvia, arising from their
  colonies or nests is so great, that a hand rubbed thereon, and applied immediately to the nose of
  a fainting person, exhilarates and refreshes equal to the spirit of hartshorn, or what is called
  sal volatile.</p>

  <p>Such are the known medicinal uses of insects; and under the article of clothing they serve us
  in a more conspicuous manner. To many thousands of persons they afford the means of living with
  comfort and happiness. Even kings are indebted to them for their grandest garments. Immense
  fortunes have been procured, by their means, to persons in trade, and the great number of people
  who daily subsist by manufacturing silk, either by spinning, weaving, or dyeing it, have the
  greatest reason to thank Providence for the institution of this insect. To the last, the Cochineal
  (Coccinella Cacti of Linnæus) affords him the power of giving our silks and cloths the most
  beautiful and lasting colours; being without it unable to produce such proofs of his ingenuity;
  not to mention many other occasions wherein this insect is peculiarly serviceable. Nor is there
  any part of the world where they do not directly, or secondarily, serve mankind for food. In every
  kingdom of the earth, where they are to be found, shrimps, prawns and crabs are eaten by all ranks
  and degrees of people, if animal food is allowed them; and our cray-fish or lobsters must not
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagexvii">{xvii}</span>be excluded from the same order. The Locust
  represented in Plate <a href="#plate50">50</a>. Fig. 2. is eaten by many tribes, and, I may say,
  nations of people, in Asia and Africa. These animals are frequently driven from their native
  soils, by strong winds, into foreign countries, where, for several days together, by their
  inconceivable numbers, they obscure the light of the sun, and make the inhabitants tremble for
  their vegetables. It is at those times the Asiatics and Africans gather them, and eat them with
  much delight, dressing them, either by stewing, or frying them with oil; they also pickle and sell
  them publicly in some of the markets of the Levant, and many other parts.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar belonging to Fig. 1. of Plate <a href="#plate38">38</a>. which I have mentioned
  in my description of that insect to be eaten in the West Indies, and considered as a dainty, is
  sought for by those persons who are admirers of that food, in the most diligent manner; and I have
  been informed, by gentlemen of undoubted veracity, that so exceedingly delighted are they with it,
  as to employ negroes on no other business but to go into the woods on purpose to procure these
  caterpillars, by digging them out of the bodies of certain trees, the only places where they are
  to be found. Perhaps the cossi of the Romans, a kind of food we are told they were much delighted
  with, might be a species not much unlike this; however that be, these are considered as amply
  recompensing, by their delicious flavour, the pains taken to procure them.</p>

  <p>Honey is a substance known to every one, and the agreeable liquor made from it, which in some
  countries serves the inhabitants for their constant drink, is not to be procured but by the
  industry of the agile bee.</p>

  <p>In fine, the limits of this preface will not permit me to dwell minutely, and point out the
  benefits mankind does, and may receive, by the institution of this order of animals. I shall again
  refer my reader to the book I mentioned before, "Stillingfleet's Tracts;" where he will find these
  and many other advantages I have not mentioned, treated of in a most ingenious manner; being the
  observations of some of the greatest men of the university of Upsal in Sweden; for this reason,
  therefore, I shall consider this subject no farther, but proceed to describe the plan of the work;
  wherein, if the reader expects to find the insects classed in systematic order, as well as
  represented, he will be greatly disappointed. It is not my present design to enter into the
  scientific part of the study, by arranging the insects according to any system now established;
  nor will the reader find that I have given a single name to any one here figured. This, indeed,
  must be the consequence of not following the system of any author, unless I had formed one of my
  own; for it is impossible I should give names to them, particularly trivial ones, without doing
  one or the other. The calling an insect by the general appellation of moth, butterfly, &amp;c. I
  cannot consider as derogatory to what I have said. Hence I flatter myself I shall avoid all
  occasion for reflection by the disciples of different authors, in not following the method
  established by others; and, therefore, my desire of giving no room for exceptions of this kind,
  has induced me to follow no one whatever. By this, also, I have left it in the power of every
  person to <span class="pagenum" id="pagexviii">{xviii}</span>class them according to his own
  fancy; and, as every one has thus an opportunity of following his favourite author, none, I hope,
  will object to a method, that will put it in his power of indulging his own inclination.</p>

  <p>I must here inform my readers, that this work can by no means be considered as a complete one.
  The most transitory view will confirm this. Nor can I take any merit to myself by its publication,
  unless the great care that has been taken to give just and accurate figures of the subjects, in
  which the different generical characters, according to the several authors I am acquainted with,
  are truly represented, will entitle me to any.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the many opportunities I have had of observing the great tendency all kinds of insects
  have to perish and decay, particularly moths and butterflies, first gave me the hint of preserving
  them from oblivion, by thus delineating them on paper. For these last are of such tender and
  delicate natures, that however pleasing and agreeable they may be to our sight, they are not
  easily to be preserved with all their gay and striking plumage. Our utmost care can only secure
  them to us a few years; and if they are exposed to air or sunshine, we are quickly robbed of them;
  the latter being capable, in a few months, of entirely destroying their colours, and the first in
  as short a space, will totally consume every part of them, leaving nothing behind but a little
  dust.</p>

  <p>Hence it is, I have been induced to give figures of foreign insects. In prosecuting which, the
  reader will find many that have never been described by any author; and if the rescuing them by
  this method from the ravages of time, if the delight and amusement arising from contemplating
  subjects of this kind, or if an attempt to promote and encourage this branch of natural history
  meets with the encouragement I hope for, I must assure the public, no labour on my side shall be
  wanting to render it complete, by adding future volumes, as the subjects I should receive from
  abroad, and my own leisure, will enable me to do; and this, I flatter myself, I shall be able to
  accomplish by the means of a few ingenious gentlemen situated in different parts of the world,
  whose correspondence I am honoured with, and by whose assistance I shall be able to give sometimes
  a tolerable history of an insect, or as much of it as has fallen within their observation; by
  which means, new subjects of speculation, some unnoticed circumstances in insect life, may arise,
  that cannot fail of being an acceptable embellishment. But I must observe, such pieces of
  information cannot be expected to be numerous; for the difficulty of procuring the natural history
  of foreign insects is so exceedingly great, that it is better conceived than described. Few
  persons, who visit foreign countries, have curiosity sufficient to prompt them to make such
  observations, or indeed any enquiry, into the works of nature. The desire of acquiring wealth, by
  the means of trade, is the grand motive that induces them to leave their native country;
  observations in natural history being generally quite foreign to their thoughts; the desire of
  extending their commerce, and making their fortunes, taking entire possession of their minds, and
  swallowing up every other consideration. Thus, we see, it is not from such persons we must expect
  any improvements tending to promote this study; it is <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexix">{xix}</span>only from men of a liberal and ingenious turn of mind, settled there,
  that we can hope to have any information of the state of nature in distant regions; and the
  scarcity of such men I have found to be exceeding great. For these reasons the reader must not
  expect to find the caterpillar and chrysalis of every insect represented. It is sufficient if I am
  able to give figures of many exotics that have hitherto been unknown. The natural history, the
  forms of the caterpillars, ways of life, haunts, &amp;c. can, in such cases, be known only to
  persons living on the spot, and who have speculation enough to observe them. Whenever I receive
  such pieces of information, they shall, certainly, not be withheld from the public.</p>

  <p>When I first engaged in the business of describing the different insects that compose the
  following work, I found myself surrounded with difficulties of so unexpected a nature, that I had
  more than once entertained thoughts of postponing, if not totally relinquishing so arduous a task.
  Nothing but the strong desire I had of promoting the study of natural history, could have led me
  to overcome a sense of my own incapacity of writing with that precision, which the public eye
  demands; and, therefore, I have reason to hope for the candid allowance of the ingenious, to
  faults, which might, perhaps, escape from the pen of a <i>master</i>, on a subject so new as the
  present. Among the rest, I laboured under no little trouble from a want of knowing what names to
  give to many colours found on the wings of some of the farinaceous tribe. The want of a
  <i>series</i>, or standard for names to colours, is a matter much to be lamented in this kingdom.
  I know no English author that has attempted it; perhaps the arduousness of the task may be the
  reason it has not been done; for if we form to ourselves an idea of the difficulty of bringing
  forth that innumerable train of colours that is to be done from only a yellow, a red and a blue,
  we may partly judge of the labour that man has to undergo who shall attempt it. In my case, the
  great variety of tints to be found on the insects, the harshness of some, the softness of others,
  together with the manner of their running into one another, increases the difficulty, and renders
  descriptions a matter of such labour, that nothing but the strongest resolution and perseverance
  could overcome. From hence, I hope, if the reader should chance to meet with any part among them,
  that does not entirely correspond with the colour given to the print, he will impute it to its
  proper cause, the painter. I know of no defects of this kind; but it is not impossible some may
  have escaped my observation, among such a multitude of figures which I had to correct. It is
  necessary I should inform the reader, that all my descriptions have been taken from the <i>natural
  subjects</i> themselves, and not from the <i>coloured prints</i> of them; and that my intention
  therein, is not to give a perfect idea of the insects, without the help of the figures, but only
  to assist the imagination in knowing what is described. And when we consider the advantages that
  good engravings have over verbal descriptions, the former representing to the mind, at first view,
  the object designed to be understood, without putting us to the trouble of calling all our ideas,
  all our powers of conception to our assistance, in order to discover what is intended to be
  described; <span class="pagenum" id="pagexx">{xx}</span>while the latter, though given by the best
  writers, often puzzles and confounds the mind, if our ideas do not keep pace with the author's
  meaning, the present work, by having every coloured figure explained, must render it superior to
  any hitherto published in this kingdom. The last author that published any figures of exotic
  subjects in natural history, was Mr. Petiver, who, in his Gazophylacium, delineated a great
  variety of all the different <i>orders</i>; many of them exceeding curious and uncommon, being
  collected from various parts of the world. But they were sent forth uncoloured, and almost
  undescribed; circumstances that render them less estimable by the difficulty there is, in many
  instances, of knowing what the author meant; the shape of the animal, plant, &amp;c. being the
  principal, and, sometimes, the only thing, we can understand. But although many of the figures
  consist of mere outlines, not exquisitely well engraved, it is not without merit. There are a
  great many very uncommon subjects exhibited, that were not known to exist in nature, till he held
  them forth to public view. It is, in short, a work, that, at the same time it manifested his
  desire for promoting his favourite study, was a proof of his assiduity, affording great room for
  speculation; and as the present is an improvement on his plan, I flatter myself it will not be
  unacceptable to the lovers of natural history. There is yet another advantage arising from the
  descriptions, that is not less than what I have already mentioned. If this work should fall into
  the hands of a bookseller, after my decease, the public would not probably be pestered with copies
  so execrably coloured, as is generally the case with books of this sort, after the author's death;
  the descriptions will be such a guide for colouring the prints, that capital errors will not be
  able to find admittance: the grossness of colouring a part yellow that should be red, or green,
  that ought to be blue, would immediately be detected; and the publisher, for his own sake, would
  undoubtedly be careful to have the prints justly and accurately done.</p>

  <p>The experienced naturalist will perceive, that, throughout the quotations, I have not availed
  myself of any of the ancient authors. I have scarcely mentioned Mouffet, Aldrovandus, and others.
  It is certain, the figures to be seen in the works of most of the ancients are so bad, I dared not
  give any quotation from them. The incorrectness of the outlines, the irregularity and impropriety
  of the spots and marks, together with the looseness of the engravings, renders them too imperfect
  for any one to venture mentioning them. Indeed they are, in general, so little expressive of the
  insect intended to be represented, that no dependance can be had on their figures, especially the
  farinaceous winged tribe. Clerck, Merian, Roesel, Petiver, &amp;c. are the authors I have
  principally mentioned, among the iconographers; and if the insect has been figured by a great many
  authors, as particularly Plate <a href="#plate34">34</a>. Fig. 7, 8. I have only mentioned a few:
  the rest may be known by looking into the Systema of Linnæus<a id="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>, under the title mentioned in the quotation. This author is the
  principal one I have quoted among the descriptive writers: his great judgment in this study, the
  plain method he has laid down for the classing of insects, together with the <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexxi">{xxi}</span>excellency of his generical characters, are what must endear him to every
  professor of this study. I speak only of that part relating to the insect kingdom; the merits of
  the other parts are best known to those conversant in the respective branches. I must not here
  pass over a circumstance, which it is proper to apprize my readers of, by way of apology for
  giving a few figures (but a few) that have been published already in this kingdom. When I first
  laid down the plan of this work, I had no intention of confining myself to those subjects that
  were non-descripts; but proposed to give figures of any exotic insects that might fall into my
  possession, or what I could procure drawings of, by the assistance of those gentlemen who were
  friends to an attempt of this sort. I was willing to promote this branch of natural history, by
  any method that lay within the compass of my little sphere. This I was the rather prompted to, by
  the consideration of its being an attempt entirely novel in this nation, and conducted in a way
  different from any yet pursued. But a little recollection convinced me I was wrong. I was soon
  sensible, that the giving figures, already known and published here, could do no service to the
  study, or benefit the reader; it is possible I might give a better figure than that before
  published; the engraving might be softer, more delicate, and better becoming the subject; or the
  colouring more exact and just: but this would not be improving the reader's judgment, or
  increasing his knowledge. In short, from that moment I altered my plan; and it is to this mistake
  a few figures are inserted in different places, which have before made their appearance in
  England, either separately, or mixed with other subjects of natural history. From that time I took
  care to delineate none that I was conscious had engaged the pencil of any preceding author; but
  confined myself to such, whose novelty and striking appearances could not fail to recommend them.
  To such non-descripts I have paid the greatest deference; for in some of the plates, among the
  butterflies and moths, I have given complete figures of both the upper and under sides; a practice
  that, as deviating from my general rule, I should not have done, if the richness and softness of
  the colouring had not been so extremely pleasing, as to render it scarcely possible to dispense
  with it. It is only to a few I have paid this particular respect. In general, I have given to the
  butterflies, only figures of one half their under sides, but whole upper ones; and of those moths
  that have no representations of their under sides, the reader may conclude there is no material
  difference between their upper and under ones, or else the latter is too poor and mean to justify
  the giving a figure of it. I must just mention, that although I used this forbearance to those
  figures that had been heretofore published, I by no means meant to debar myself from representing
  such as had been only <i>verbally</i> described; as is the case with a great many to be met with
  in the Systema of Linnæus, and in other authors. The refraining, therefore, from such subjects,
  would have been rather condemnable than fit to be approved, for the reasons I mentioned before, of
  the great difficulty there is in understanding, sometimes, the best verbal descriptions that ever
  were given; therefore figures of this kind may not improperly be considered as explanatory, or as
  illustrations to <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxii">{xxii}</span>such verbal descriptions,
  affording the student a two-fold pleasure, by comparing them together.</p>

  <p>If the reader has made no progress in the study of natural history, he will probably find it
  difficult to understand the several <i>names</i>, or <i>terms</i>, the different parts of insects
  are called by; and which occur in every description. For this reason I think it incumbent on me to
  give the most plain and familiar explanation of them I possibly can. This I have done two ways; by
  methodical definitions, and figures; and in both of them shall make no scruple to follow the
  method laid down by that great master of natural history, the judicious Linnæus, whose excellent
  plan, for the knowledge and classing of insects, demands the utmost thanks and regard from every
  lover of this branch of science. From his plan I have taken the hint of giving some figures of
  different genera, with the proper names of the respective parts in a plate by themselves. By these
  the reader will not only be greatly assisted in understanding the descriptions; but it will enable
  him to class them with more facility, if he is inclined to do so. I therefore go on to explain,
  first the <i>terms</i> used throughout the whole; and afterwards the distinct and different
  <i>parts</i> of insects. In doing this, I divide them into</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Order</span>, <span class="sc">Class</span>, <span
  class="sc">Genus</span>, and <span class="sc">Species</span>.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p><i>Order</i>, is a general term, applicable to a whole race of animals, whereby they are
    distinguished from each other, as beasts, birds, fishes, &amp;c.<a id="NtA_13"
    href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
    <p><i>Class</i>, a term by which insects, as well as other animals, are divided into their
    respective genera or tribes, as the farinaceous, crustaceous, transparent, &amp;c.<a id="NtA_14"
    href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
    <p><i>Genus</i>, a term dividing each class, as butterfly, moth, hawk-moth, constitute the
    farinaceous (Lepidoptera); dung-beetle, lady-bird, goat-chaffer, and many others, make up the
    crustaceous (Coleoptera); cockroach, locust, bug, and some others, form the semi-crustaceous
    (Hemiptera, Linn.), &amp;c.<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Species</i>, a term comprehending a distinct or individual sort in each genus,
    as the pearl-bordered, admirable, skipper, &amp;c. among the butterflies; egger, drinker,
    peppered, &amp;c. among moths, &amp;c.</p>
  </div>

  <p>To these I must add the word</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Variety</i>, a term by which two insects of the same species are known, though
    differing a little (not characteristically) in colour, size, &amp;c.<a id="NtA_16"
    href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexxiii">{xxiii}</span></div>

  <p>I shall next proceed to explain and describe the different parts composing insects, by dividing
  them into the Head, Thorax, Abdomen, and Limbs.<a id="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Head</span> (Fig. 1, 2, 3, <i>a</i>.) includes the <span
  class="smaller">ANTENNÆ</span>, <span class="smaller">MOUTH</span>, <span
  class="smaller">PALPI</span>, <span class="smaller">EYES</span>, <span
  class="smaller">TONGUE</span>, <span class="smaller">JAWS</span>, and <span
  class="smaller">HORNS</span>.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp3">
    <p>The <i>Antennæ</i> are formed of various shapes, according to the different genera, as may be
    observed in the figures, and seem instituted by nature not only for guiding the animal in its
    passage, but likewise for other purposes; being endued with an exquisite sense of feeling and
    perception. Fig. 1. <i>d d</i>. Fig. 2. <i>c</i>. Fig. 3. <i>c c</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>Mouth</i> is placed in the head, but sometimes close to the breast, as in the spider
    tribe; sometimes terminating in a horny beak, as in Plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>. Fig. 1.
    also in Plate <a href="#plate42">42</a>. Fig. 3 and 7. In some it is furnished with strong
    mandibles like pincers, as in Plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>. Fig. 6. and Plate <a
    href="#plate37">37</a>. Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In others it is so covered and guarded by the
    palpi, particularly among the moths, that it is not to be seen.</p>
    <p>The <i>Palpi</i> are parts placed close to the mouth, and variously shaped; as may be seen by
    comparing those of the Lepidopterous with those of the Coleopterous, and other tribes;
    consisting of a greater or less number according to the species or genus; in some being only
    two, in most of them four, and in some six, (Cicindela, Carabus, Linn.) The use and purpose of
    these parts we are ignorant of. Fig. 1. <i>c c</i>. Fig. 2. <i>b</i>. Fig. 3. <i>b b</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>Eyes</i> are generally immoveable, and suited differently; in some to see only in the
    night, in others in the day; and differ in number according to the genera and species, having in
    general two only, but in some five,<a id="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> in others
    eight, as the spiders. Fig. 1. <i>b b</i>. Fig. 3. <i>d d</i>.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The <i>Tongue</i> (elongated maxillæ) is sometimes curled up spirally like the
    spring of a watch, as in butterflies and some moths, &amp;c. in others it (including the labium)
    is doubled under the head, as in bees and wasps; but a great many species are destitute of this
    elongated part.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Thorax</span> is principally composed of the <span
  class="smaller">BACK</span>, <span class="smaller">BREAST</span>, and in some the <span
  class="smaller">SCUTELLUM</span>, in others the <span class="smaller">MESOSTERNUM</span> and <span
  class="smaller">DILATED POSTERIOR COXÆ</span>.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp3">
    <p>The <i>Back</i>, dorsum or upper part, answering to the back in some animals, terminates in
    some species in a triangular manner, so as to represent the scutellum, as in Plate <a
    href="#plate33">33</a>. Fig. 5, 6, and 8. Tab. Ann. Fig. 1. <i>f</i>. Fig. 2. <i>e</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>Breast</i>, or sternum, is the under part of the thorax, and always furnished with
    legs.</p>
    <p>The <i>Scutellum</i> is a small but hard part like a scale, frequently of a triangular shape,
    placed behind the dorsum of the prothorax, and joining to it. It is not developed in every
    genus, being chiefly perceived in the Coleopterous, Hemipterous, and transparent-winged
    orders.</p>
    <p>The <i>Mesosternum</i> is united to the fore part of the breast, extending beyond the middle
    legs towards the fore ones; and observable only in some species of the Coleopterous order. By
    Linnæus and several other authors it is called sternum.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexxiv">{xxiv}</span></div>
    <p>The <i>Posterior Coxæ</i> are only conspicuously enlarged in some particular species (dung
    beetles). There are two of them placed on the sides of the breast next to the abdomen, under the
    hinder thighs. In some they are placed remote and distinct from it, in others they lie close;
    being moveable in some, in others they are fixed. The use of these parts we are ignorant of.<a
    id="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>
    <p class="sp0">The <i>Abdomen</i> consists of a number of annuli or rings, and contains the
    greatest part of the intestines and other viscera; being united to the trunk, and formed with
    holes on the sides, through which the insect breathes.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Limbs</span> comprehend the <span class="smaller">TAIL</span>, <span
  class="smaller">LEGS</span>, and <span class="smaller">WINGS</span>, with their cases.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>The <i>Tail</i> is placed at the extremity of the abdomen; and in some is furnished with a
    sting, in others it is armed with a pair of forceps; sometimes with a single bristle, sometimes
    with a double one; in some with a pair of claws like a crab, in others like a fork.</p>
    <p>The <i>Legs</i> include the coxæ, trochanters, femora, tibiæ, and tarsi; the latter
    consisting of two, sometimes of three, four, or five articulations. In some the fore ones
    resemble a crab's claws. Some are furnished with spines, others are smooth and plain. The hinder
    ones are formed for running, leaping, or swimming.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The <i>Wings</i>, being always two or four, are either plain or folded, erect or
    open, lying flat or inclining downwards, &amp;c. In some they are dentated or scolloped; and
    some are furnished with two projections like tails. They are also membranaceous, reticulated, or
    transparent, and frequently adorned with beautiful colours. In some they are curiously folded
    within two crustaceous cases, that are either smooth or rough, striated, furrowed, punctated,
    &amp;c. in some these cases are soft and flexile, in others hard like horn; the Hemipterous are
    partly soft and transparent, as in Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>. Fig. 2. and partly opake and
    hard, as in Plate <a href="#plate42">42</a>. Fig. 1. Plate <a href="#plate43">43</a>. Fig. 2.
    and Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>. Fig. 5.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is necessary to observe, that I have not been so prolix and explanatory in the foregoing
  definitions as I should be, if I intended to arrange the figures under their respective classes,
  or establish any system for doing so; I have explained no more <i>terms</i> or <i>parts</i> than
  what are sufficient to enable the reader (if he is not an adept) easily and clearly to understand
  the descriptions. It is likewise necessary to mention, that I have given English names to most of
  the parts, where I could do it with the necessary propriety for serving this particular purpose;
  and where I could not substitute an English word, that was apposite and significant, I have
  preserved the Latin one, as used by Linnæus and others. Thus, for instance, the term palpi I would
  have altered, if I could have found an English word that conveyed the same idea; but not easily
  finding one, I have kept to the original. I have not forgot the terms mustachios, whiskers,
  &amp;c. which I might have used in its stead; but as these parts in many insects bore no analogy
  or resemblance thereto, it being in a great many of them like a short jointed filament or thread,
  I rather chose to preserve the Latin one. The same practice I have observed with the term antennæ.
  For though feelers is the general explanation given to this word, I could not prevail with myself
  to use it. The reason is, because these animals seem to have a power <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexxv">{xxv}</span>of applying these parts to purposes different from that of feeling. By
  the antennæ they are capable of distinguishing and perceiving, as well as feeling; and I am
  strongly inclined to believe, it is by them the males are capable of discovering the females at a
  great distance. It is certain their powers of perception are very obvious and remarkable, which,
  by close observations, we may soon discover; and unless we allow them capable of smelling without
  nostrils, I do not know what parts they exercise, or by what means they so readily discover, not
  only their females but their respective kinds of food, the places proper for depositing their
  eggs, &amp;c. The male moths appear to have this faculty of discovering their females in a greater
  degree than most other insects; for there are but a very few, if any, belonging to this genus,
  whose females pass the first night after they quit the chrysalis without coupling with the males;
  owing to unconquerable <i>desire</i> in the latter, and the strong effluvia or scent emitted by
  the former for attracting their mates. Every adept is fully acquainted that a female moth, known
  by the name of the Egger (Phalæna Quercus of Linnæus), taken into the fields the first day it is
  hatched, will most certainly (though shut up in a box) allure all the males round the country that
  are within the sphere of its attraction, and even from a great distance; who will at first fly
  round the box with wonderful swiftness and eagerness, and afterwards settling thereon will hunt
  and run about it with the greatest impatience, endeavouring to get at the inclosed female; and all
  this from the strongest desire of copulation; for the minute that action is performed by a male,
  the attractive property of the other ceases. The powers of perception and distinction, therefore,
  are very great; and what parts of the insects, unless it be the antennæ, are employed in this
  search I am at a loss to discover. However, at present, I presume it will not be necessary to
  offer any further reasons for using this term, as the name substituted is sufficient for it to be
  known by, it will fully answer the intended purpose.</p>

  <p>The names of the other parts are too intelligible to require any explanation.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The plate annexed (being the last thing I shall speak of) requires but little to be
  said in its favour. The use and advantage of it is too obvious to dwell on. I have already
  mentioned, that engravings and delineations claim the preference in the highest degree of verbal
  descriptions; and as such, I presume, the reader will find this plate of the greatest service in
  assisting him to understand the descriptive parts with clearness and ease. I must only recommend
  it to him, if he is desirous of avoiding difficulty and trouble, to make himself fully acquainted
  with the terms and names of all the parts of insects, before he begins to read the
  descriptions.</p>

    <p><i>Upper Side.</i> The anterior wings are of a fine chocolate, with an orange-coloured margin
    running along the exterior edge, within which are some faint round orange spots; those next the
    anterior edge, where they begin, being strongest. The posterior wings are furnished with four
    tails (the outer ones being the shortest) and are of a blue black. A yellow scolloped margin
    runs round their external edges, verged with black; above which are some lunate spots of a sky
    blue.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> The anterior wings, next the body, are of a faint dark red,
    with many spots and marks of a dirty olive, differently shaped, margined with white. An orange
    margin runs along the exterior edge, intersected by the blue tendons; and above it are several
    triangular marks of a faint orange, on a blueish hazel ground, which deadens as it approaches
    the margin. The posterior wings have on each a white band, running transversely, and meeting
    just below the extremity of the body; within which, and including the anal groove, are many
    round, oval, and other shaped marks of chocolate and dark olive; verged with white. A scolloped
    margin, of a deep lemon colour, runs along the posterior edges, verged with dirty green, and
    separated from the white band by a bar of hazel colour, and some large brown reddish spots and
    marks. Two blue spots are placed just above the two longest tails, with several lesser ones,
    just above the lemon-coloured margin.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I have thought it more in accordance with the principles which are now almost universally
  adopted, in regulating specific nomenclature, to revert to the original Linnæan <span
  class="pagenum" id="page2">{2}</span>name of Jason in preference to that of Fabricius. This
  butterfly may be regarded as one of the most splendid of the Lepidoptera of Europe, to the
  southern portion of which and to the northern shores of Africa it appears to be confined. The
  strength of its general structure indicates great powers of flight, and we accordingly find that
  it is able to sustain itself in the air with very little motion of the wings. The female differs
  from the male only by having the centre of the posterior wings adorned with small blue spots on
  the upper side. There are two broods in the year, namely in June and September, and, according to
  M. De Villiers, the insect emits a strong scent of musk. The caterpillar is naked and thickened in
  the middle of the body; the tail tapering into two short points, the head is also armed with two
  conical erect horns. In this respect, therefore, this insect very nearly approaches the genus
  Apatura, of which the purple Emperor, Ap. Iris is the type, thus proving the advantages to be
  obtained, in studying the natural relations of this difficult order of Annulosa, from an accurate
  acquaintance with the structure and habits of the early stages of the insect.</p>

  <p>There are several species, having the same general form as the Jason, including Athamas, pl. <a
  href="#plate2">2</a>. fig. 3. 4; Eudoxus, vol. iii. pl. <a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47601/47601-h/47601-h.htm#plate33">33</a>. f. 1. 4; Camulus,

  f. 1. 2. Mr. Swainson has, accordingly, formed them into a distinct group, to which he has given
  the name of Jasia, in pursuance with his customary, but scarcely correct plan, of raising the
  specific name of the typical species into a generic name, and then giving a new specific name to
  such type. M. Boisduval, rejecting this system of nomenclature, has more recently proposed for the
  same group the name of Charaxes, which I have adopted.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Amongst the species very nearly resembling Jason, is one sent from Africa<a
  id="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> to Mr. Drury by Mr. Smeathman, which, according to
  the observations of that traveller, published by Drury, in the introduction to his third volume,
  flies in the heat of the day with amazing rapidity, and seldom descends within eight feet of the
  ground. It glances from the prominent branches of one tree to those of another, as swift as a
  swallow, and turns its head about instantly to the glade, or path, and will not suffer any person
  to approach within a striking distance of it, but darts away on the least motion of the body. If
  the collector exert his patience it will at last become more familiar and careless, and is then to
  be caught upon some particular branch, to which it will appear more attached than to another.</p>

    with black. The anterior wings are cream coloured, spotted with black. The number of spots very
    uncertain, except five which are placed on the anterior edge, and six on the external one. The

    abdomen yellow, with black spots on the sides and top, the extremity being white. All the wings
    are white, with black spots, whose number is very variable; but, on the anterior edges of each
    anterior wing, are placed five, and on the external edges, six.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side</i>. The legs are black and white, the thighs yellow; the abdomen
    white, spotted with black. All the wings are white, with black spots, most of which, observed on

  <p class="sp3">This species is closely allied to the common British species, Spilosoma
  lubricepida, and Menthrastri; but is of larger size, the spots being also larger. The two figures
  given by Drury, are now ascertained to be the sexes of the same species, as, indeed, our author
  had surmised might be the case. It appears to be a very common species, and is stated by Drury to
  breed twice a year, namely, in June and September. The caterpillar is very hairy, and when young
  is white; as it advances in age, it acquires a fox colour, and, in its last skin, becomes almost
  black. Dr. Thaddeus W. Harris, a distinguished American entomologist, to whom I am indebted for
  many valuable insects of that country, has published a very interesting notice, in the work above
  cited, upon this insect, under the title of "The Natural History of the Salt-marsh Caterpillar,"
  under which name the larva of this insect is commonly known, and which is exceedingly destructive
  to grasses of various kinds. He states, that when nearly full-fed, "they become very voracious,
  and continue eating all the day and night without intermission. Soon they leave the meadows,
  aggregated in great numbers, and commence the wandering state, or begin to run, as is the phrase,
  devouring everything in their progress; corn-fields, gardens, and even the coarse and rank <span
  class="pagenum" id="page8">{8}</span>produce of road sides, afford them temporary nourishment,
  until they have found a place of security from the wind and weather." Dr. Harris, in a
  communication to me, has stated, that he had ascertained that this insect was the Acria of
  Fabricius, and that Professor Peck's name must, therefore, be rejected. Abbot observes, respecting
  this caterpillar, that it is "a general devourer of all field and garden-plants, and weeds. It
  spun up in a thin web, intermixed with its own hairs, on the 16th of May, and the moth came out on
  the 2d of June. Others of the autumnal brood, taken in September, spun up on the 18th of that
  month, and remained in the chrysalis until the 21st of April."</p>

    <p><i>Upper Side.</i> The anterior wings are dentated and black: the anterior edge of a dirty
    olive brown; in the middle whereof a broad white bar arises, and runs transversely towards the
    middle of the external edge, where, stopping at the distance of a quarter of an inch, it forms,
    with some faint white spots, a black border along the external edge, whereon is a row of narrow
    white angulated marks. The posterior wings, which are deeply dentated, are white; with a deep
    black border running along the external edge, whereon is a row of white angulated marks, as on
    the superior wings, and above each of them is a series of short white streaks, running parallel
    with the edge of the wing. Above these are six round black spots, one situated between each
    nerve, and over them six more smaller, and fainter; several more spots being dispersed on the
    white parts of the wings, some very distinct, and others very faint.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> The anterior wings are red, which colour extends from the base
    nearly half along the wing, and which, towards the posterior edge, softens to a cream-colour. On
    this red ground are some short black lines, with blue ones between them, extending between the
    two principal nerves. The external edge has a black margin; whereon the white angular marks are
    seen more distinctly, being here shaped like beards of arrows. Above this border, near the
    external angle, are two oval black spots, or eyes, whose irides are white, having between them
    and the black border a row of small, round, black spots, placed close together. The white bar
    described on the upper side is also seen here. Several more black spots, of various forms, are
    dispersed on different parts, particularly a group in the centre of the wing. The inferior wings
    are white, with pale cream-coloured clouds; but next the base are white, blue, and red, with
    black streaks, from whence a shade of blue and brown runs along the anterior edge to the
    external angle, where a black border commences, whereon are angular white marks, like arrow
    beards or points. This border continues to the abdominal corners, where two small, curved, black
    lines meet together, and form an arch. Above the black border is a row of small black spots, and
    above them are six larger, with several others, of different shapes and sizes, dispersed on
    various parts of the wings.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The insect described in the Encyclopédie Méthodique, from Malabar, differs from
  that figured by Drury, in having the disc of the posterior wings of a fulvous buff colour, and the
  spots larger, with the markings at the base of this pair of wings, on the under side fulvous
  instead of blue. Is this to be regarded as a variety, the opposite sex, or a distinct species?</p>

    the wings; the other half, next the tips, are of a rusty red brown, whereon is a row of white
    crescents running along the external edge. Above this are five white squarish spots, and over
    them a row of angulated marks, like points of arrows, with white spots in their centres, above
    which is a single white spot, between which and the shoulders are some short black waved lines,
    extending between the two principal nerves. The posterior wings are entirely of a brown orange,
    except a rusty red-brown border that runs along the external edge, whereon is a row of white
    crescents, and above it are six black spots running parallel with the border, beneath which is a
    denticulated line of dark brown.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> The anterior wings, next the shoulders, are of a brown orange,
    reaching half way along the wings, the remainder being rusty yellow. On the orange ground, next
    the shoulders, are several black, irregular, short lines, placed two and two, the middle, or
    spaces between them, being clay-coloured. Two small black spots are placed on the anterior edge,
    on each side near the base. Along the external edge is a row of white angulated lines, above
    which is a row of ash-coloured marks, with some dark spots thereon; and over this, is another
    row of ash-coloured marks, shaped like acute angles, with an oblong streak in the centre of
    each. The posterior wings at the base are dark orange, but toward the external edges are rusty
    yellow, on which is a row of crescents on a dark border. Above this is a circular bar or band of
    a flesh colour, having a row of dark spots on the lower edge, and the upper edge shaped like
    acute angles, with a black triangular mark in each, and a white spot in its centre. About a
    quarter of an inch above this bar is another of a clay colour, about one-eighth of an inch
    broad, with dark spots and marks on it, some of which resemble Greek characters. Over this bar
    is another near the base, of a clay colour, with a double row of black marks or streaks on
    it.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Fabricius has confounded this species and another, under the name of Penthesilea.
  Latreille and Godart have altered the specific name proposed by Drury to that of Biblina, "parce
  qu'il a été imposé ultérieurement à un genre de Lépidoptères diurnes." I have, however, restored
  the specific name of Biblis, because the same name, was not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page10">{10}</span>proposed for a genus by Fabricius, until many years after the publication
  of Drury's work, in the Synopsis of the Systema Glossatorum, published in Illiger's Magazine; and
  because the employment of a proper name, like Biblis, for a species, even when previously used for
  a genus belonging to a perfectly distinct group, is not incorrect.</p>

    angle, the largest being round. The remainder of the wings is of a fine orange brown, with
    several black marks thereon, near the anterior edges. The posterior wings are a little dentated,
    and of a brown orange colour like the anterior, having five black spots placed near the external
    edge of each, two of which being larger than the rest have blue centres, below these is a black
    border, with a row of brown-orange crescents running along the middle. The cilia is black and
    white.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> The anterior wings at the base are greyish, beyond which they
    are beautifully adorned with rose-coloured and black marks, having three white spots on each
    near the external edge, with several clouds and marks of different colours placed at the tips
    and anterior edges. The posterior wings are of a beautiful agate colour, with many lines and
    narrow bars branching from, and intersecting one another under different directions (like lines
    in a map), so as to form spots and clouds of different shapes. Each wing has two eyes placed
    near the external edge, one larger than the other, the pupils being of a blueish hue and the
    irides black, the small one having a yellow circle within it; below these, a purple line runs
    parallel with, and near to the external edge.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The caterpillar of this insect is described by Drury as being green, with black rings round the
  body, and as feeding about New York upon the wild balsams, appearing about the latter end of July,
  or beginning of August. Once in about five or six years they are exceedingly plentiful, at other
  times very scarce; a peculiarity also noticed in the very nearly allied European species, Cynthia
  Cardui (the Painted lady), of which species, indeed, Drury appears to have regarded it as a
  geographical variety.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The caterpillar, according to Abbot, is of a brown colour, with the incisions, and
  a <span class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}</span>lateral line yellow; it has also two dorsal lines,
  formed of alternately white and red points; the head is black, and the spines, with which the body
  is armed, are of the prevalent colour of the surface. It feeds upon the Gnaphalum obtusifolium.
  The chrysalis is rather yellow, with black spots, and is assumed towards the end of April or
  beginning of May. The butterfly appears at the end of about ten days. It continues breeding during
  the summer, and is very commonly seen sucking up moisture from damp places near houses. The
  caterpillar folds and spins the leaves together, in the same manner as the English Painted lady,
  Cynthia Cardui.</p>

  nearly allied species, which would be very difficult to unravel. Drury considered this insect as a
  variety of Evippe, whilst Fabricius, Latrielle, and Godart, give it as identical with the Linnæan
  Pyrene, which opinion I have adopted, although I am by no means certain as to the identity of the
  species; the under side of the wings offering no trace of the central discoidal black spot
  existing in that species. M. Boisduval has not diminished the confusion, in his work just
  published, by giving a species from Guinea, under the name of Evippe (which Linnæus states is from
  China), with the erroneous observation, "Il est probable que les anciens auteurs auront confondu
  sous le nom d'Evippe trois ou quatre espèces <i>Africaines</i>."&mdash;<i>Hist. Nat. Lépid.</i> 1.

    <p><i>Upper Side.</i> The antennæ are about an inch long, slender, setaceous, and gradually
    diminishing from the base to the extremities. The head is small. The thorax is clothed with long
    soft hair, and, <span class="pagenum" id="page14">{14}</span>with the abdomen, is of a darkish
    brown. A remarkable straight narrow line, or bar, of a cream colour, arises from the middle of
    the anterior edge of each of the fore wings, and, crossing both anterior and posterior wings,
    ends at the abdominal edges, about half an inch below the abdomen; so that, when the wings are
    extended, as in the figure, these lines, with the anterior edges, form an equilateral triangle.
    The space within the triangle is dark brown; but the parts, near the shoulders, are lighter,
    having a greyish cast or hue, and contain many small transverse curved streaks, extending to the
    anterior edges, where they are large, black, and very conspicuous, like stripes. Some transverse
    markings of this kind, are dispersed on the posterior edges of the superior wings, and also on
    the abdominal edges of the posterior. On the outside the triangle, both on the anterior and
    posterior wings, is a fascia, of light brown, about half an inch broad, which deepens into a
    dark brown. On the posterior wings, after becoming dark, it softens again into the same light
    colour, continuing to the external edges. Each of these wings is ornamented with two tails, the
    inner ones the longest and near an inch in length, the tips of which incline towards each other;
    the lesser or outer tails, are about half an inch long, strengthened by the tendons of the wings
    passing through the middle of them; all of them being bordered with a soft ray of dark
    brown.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> The bars or lines, which form the triangle on the upper side,
    are not visible on this; but the inclosed triangular field appears of a light greyish brown,
    darker at the borders, and thickly beset with small brown streaks, parallel to each other, and
    surrounding the body. The costal nerve of the anterior wings composes an edging in each, about
    an eighth of an inch broad, which diminishes as it approaches the external angle, white, and
    beautifully marked with black streaks, but smaller than those seen on the upper side. Outside
    the triangle, both in the anterior and posterior wings, is a broad border of white, which
    softens into a brown, but lighter than that on the upper side. Both in the white, and in the
    brown, are some small dashes of black, very thinly dispersed. The internal margin of the
    posterior wings is furnished with a deep fringe, and the black marks situated below the abdomen,
    are larger and broader than those on the upper side. The tails are whitish, bordered with brown,
    and appear as on the upper side.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">This is one of those anomalous forms, whereof examples occur in every tribe of
  animals, baffling the skill of the most profound systematists. By Linnæus, and many other authors,
  it was considered as a butterfly, and certainly the genus Urania (in which it is placed by
  Latreille), as we learn from Mr. W. S. MacLeay's valuable memoir upon that genus, published in the
  first volume of the Transactions of the Zoological Society of London, is composed of day-flying
  species. Fabricius, however, regarded it as a moth, belonging to the genus Noctua, and nearly
  related to the genus Erebus, of which the Erebus Odora, figured in the third plate of the present
  volume, is a conspicuous species; and when we examine the structure of the palpi, and the spurs
  upon the posterior tibiæ, we find good reason for adopting this relation, admitting, at the same
  time, that the group in question is one which, from its various affinities and analogies, it is
  very difficult to assign to any single section.</p>

  the moth appeared on the 29th. Another spun up on the 27th of May, and came out on the 16th of
  June. It continues breeding during most part of the summer.</p>

    abdomen yellow, clouded with a light reddish-brown colour, inclining to crimson. The anterior
    wings are of a fine bright yellow, with several clouds on them of the same brown colour, whereof
    one takes its rise at the tips, and runs along the external edge to the lower corners, being
    narrower at the extremities than the middle, where it branches off, and unites to a large cloud
    near the shoulders. The yellow parts of all the wings appear as if sprinkled with dark irregular
    specks. The posterior wings are of the same bright yellow as the anterior, and have, in the
    middle of each, a small brown eye, with a lighter spot in its centre. An irregular bar of the
    same reddish brown colour crosses these wings, which, beginning at the outer angle, meets at the

    it. The anterior margins next the body are of a reddish brown; and the same cloud that appears
    along the external edge of each wing on the upper side, appears also on this, but fainter. The

  <p class="sp3">This species breeds twice in the year, namely in June and September. The
  caterpillar, according to Abbot, feeds on the plane-tree (Platanus occidentalis Linn.), oak,
  liquidambar, and pine trees. Some of them are of a tawny colour, others tawny and orange, others
  green. They are furnished with long rigid hairs, and the second and third segments of the body are
  also armed with two pair of short, erect, rugose horns. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page18">{18}</span>This insect is placed by Mr. Kirby in his new genus Cerocampa, together
  with Phalæna regalis, Fabr. Mr. Kirby had, however, evidently in view the caterpillars of the
  latter insect, when he proposed this generic name, and which are armed with numerous, long, erect,
  rigid spines, those near the head being curved, and giving the insect somewhat the appearance of a
  cockatoo. This larva is figured by Abbot and Smith, pl. 61, and specimens, admirably preserved by
  Abbot, are contained in the collection of the Entomological Society of London, presented by Mr.
  Kirby. There is also considerable difference between the chrysalides of these two insects, that of

  spines, of which the chrysalis of regalis is destitute. One of the caterpillars observed by Abbot,
  went into the ground on the 16th of September, and the moth came out on the 4th of July. They are
  extremely difficult to rear in confinement.</p>

  somewhat rugose, being transversely shagreened; it feeds upon the Capparis. The pupa is navicular,

  <p class="sp3">This butterfly is one of the most beautiful, and, at the same time, most common of
  the North American species; abounding wherever the Aristolochia serpentaria grows, the larva
  feeding upon that plant. It is described by Boisduval and Abbot, and is brown, with four rows of
  small fulvous tubercles, and a row of brown spines near the legs; moreover, it has two long spines
  directed forwards upon the first segment, three upon the penultimate, and two upon the tenth
  segment. The neck is also furnished with a furcate retractile reddish tentacle; the chrysalis is
  of a violet grey, or reddish colour, with two yellow spots, the head being truncate. The female is
  larger, with brown-coloured wings, with cupreous reflections. The insect assumes the chrysalis
  state on the 26th of April, and the fly appears on the 4th of May. Another, observed by Abbot,
  went into chrysalis on the 21st of June, and the butterfly came out on the 5th July. The latter

    same. <span class="pagenum" id="page22">{22}</span>Anterior wings black. A row of eight or nine
    yellow spots runs along each wing, near the external edge. Within these appears another row,
    smaller in figure 3, but larger in figure 2, and shaped like triangles, above which are two
    spots, one nearly round, the other very oblong, which last is not seen in figure 3. Posterior
    wings black and dentated, with one tail issuing from each. Six yellow spots appear near the
    external edge; and at the anal angle is an orange-coloured one, with a black dot in its centre.
    Some specimens have a yellow bar running transversely from the row of triangles on the superior
    wings, and meeting below the extremity of the body, just above the orange spot, as in fig. 2. In
    some, instead of a bar, is seen a row of spots (as in fig. 3), which are sometimes very faint.
    Where this happens, the space between this row and the six spots mentioned before, consists of a
    shining blue colour; but in proportion as the yellow bar is more or less distinct, the wings
    have more or less blue on them.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> The under side in all the different varieties differs but very
    little. The breast, sides, abdomen and feet are black. The anterior wings of a dirty black
    colour, with nine yellow spots near the external edge; above these, nearer the body, are eight
    others, varying in size, and two small clouds or patches close to the anterior edge. Posterior
    wings, next the shoulders, dirty black, with the inner scollops edged with yellow crescents
    (appearing also on the upper side), within which are six spots near the edge&mdash;four orange
    and two yellow. Seven or eight orange spots, tipped with yellow, run circularly across the
    middle of the wing. Below each spot in this row is a ray of shining blue, separated by a strong
    black mark, and scattered with powder-like spots. An orange spot, with a black centre, is placed
    at the anal angle.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">This species is subject to considerable variation in the size of the internal
  series of yellow spots, which is sometimes even entirely obliterated in the females, in which the
  yellow is much less brilliant, and the spots smaller than in the males. These varieties somewhat
  resemble Papilio Troilus of Linnæus, with which, indeed, Drury and Smith<a id="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> confounded the insect here described. Godart and Boisduval have
  added to the confusion by their incorrect references to our author, the first of these writers
  giving figure 2 of this plate as alone representing P. Asterias, and figs. 3, 4, and 5, (which
  represent two distinct species) as P. Troilus, Linn. which species Drury has not figured; and both
  of these authors quoting figure 2, both under Troilus and Asterias, although Drury expressly
  states, that the specimens figured at 2 and 3, were reared by him, with many other individuals,
  from chrysalides, sent from America by his correspondent, who assured him that they proceeded from
  the same brood. The preparatory states of P. Asterias are figured by Abbot and Smith, and
  Boisduval. The larva feeds upon Umbelliferæ, especially the fennel (Anethum fæniculum, Linn.), and
  Daucus Carota, and is very similar to that of Pap. Machaon, which species appears to be replaced
  in America by P. Asterias, and which makes its appearance in the perfect state three times in the
  year. Abbot states, that one of the caterpillars assumed the chrysalis state on the 12th of July,
  and the imago appeared on the 20th.</p>

    powder-like specks of a fine green. On the posterior margin of the anterior wings, near the
    lower corner, arises a series of green spots, becoming weaker, disappearing near the middle of
    the wing, and composed of powder-like specks. Posterior wings scolloped or dentated, each
    furnished with one tail, each scollop being edged with white. At the anal angle, near the
    corner, is a deep red spot, shaped like a semi-eye, whose pupil is black; and towards the upper
    corner of the wing, is a large and very splendid blue spot, appearing in some directions of a
    saxon green colour, and diminishing to a line as it approaches the semi-eye, over which it
    extends in an arch-like form, being there of a fine green colour.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> It has apparently no palpi. Breast and abdomen of a very dark
    brown. The superior wings dark brown at the base; from the middle of the anterior edge of a dark
    ash colour, running towards the upper corner, the tendons between being dark brown, which unite
    together at the external edge. Posterior wings almost black, sprinkled, or finely powdered, with

  <p>This very handsome species is often received from China, but in an imperfect condition. The
  female, according to Godart (Enc. Méth. ix. p. 67.) is the Papilio Bianor, Fabr. which has no
  trace of the shining green spot on the posterior wings. M. Boisduval, however, asserts, that this
  is not correct, and that the female differs only from the male in having the ground of the wings
  rather darker, and possessing a transverse interrupted fascia of green dots near the external
  margin of the upper wing; these being represented in Drury's figure, therefore indicate that his
  specimen was of the female sex.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Dr. Horsfield has figured another species from Java (Lepid. Javan. pl. 1. fig.
  14.), differing very slightly from the preceding, under the name of Papilio Arjuna, of which he
  has also figured the larva and pupa (pl. 4. fig. 11.). The former has the three first segments of
  the body covered, as it were, with a leathery shield, elevated behind, and ornamented with several
  ocelli; the other segments are simple; the chrysalis is considerably curved, with the head
  bifid.</p>

    extends down the external edge to the interior angle, and also runs a little way along the

    lying flat on the wing.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">There is much confusion respecting the specific names of this and several other
  Asiatic species, as may be seen from the citations in the synonyms. I have followed the French
  authors in assigning Drury's insect to the Pyranthe of Linnæus, although that author describes his
  insect as having a discoidal red spot on each of the wings beneath. The species of this group are
  variable in the intensity of their markings, and the males are less strongly marked than the
  females; and as Drury's figure represents a male (distinguished by the bundle of hairs on the
  interior margin of the anterior wings) it may possibly be an extreme variety of the male of
  Pyranthe. Boisduval has indeed described another species of considerably smaller size, which is
  destitute of the discoidal spot (Call. minna), which also, he considers, may possibly be a variety
  of C. Pyranthe.</p>

    the thorax and abdomen, is of a blackish brown. Wings dentated, and of a dark chocolate colour,
    almost black; but when held against the light, in a certain direction, display a blueish purple.
    Anterior wings, in the middle, having a large oval, and another smaller oblong white spot at the
    tips. Posterior wings with a large white spot, larger than that in the superior ones. On the
    edges of all these spots, the purple colour before-mentioned, is very conspicuous.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> Palpi white. The sides of the thorax spotted with white.
    Anterior wings, next the body, of a reddish chocolate; but near the tips, of a dirty olive. The
    large and small white spots appear here as on the upper side; with three small angular white
    spots, close to the anterior margin, near the middle. Along the external edge, is a row of white
    crescents on a black border; over which are six small, round, faint, white spots. Posterior
    wings, next the body, of a dirty olive; but toward their external edges, more of a chocolate,
    with a broad central white bar running entirely across the wing, with a small angular black
    mark, near the anterior margin. Along the external edges, is a row of white crescents; above
    which is a row of small white triangular spots, placed two and two, between the crescents. Above
    this, six small round white spots are placed in a row.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The flight of this species is said by Drury to be exceedingly quick and rapid, so
  that it is very difficult to catch them, and hence they are seldom obtained in fine condition,
  being generally secured in a faded state when they are taken with more ease. The purple tint upon
  the upper side of the wings is most intense, and when the insect flies in the sun, glancing before
  the eye of the observer at a little distance (for it is by no means a timid creature), the vivid
  purple, observes Drury, is not much less than the electrical spark, and its changes depending on
  the degree of obliquity which it presents to the sun, are scarcely less rapid.</p>

    <p><i>Upper Side.</i> Antennæ, thorax, and abdomen of a dark brown colour. All the wings dark
    olive brown. On the anterior wings, near the tips, are two black circular spots united together:
    the lower one being the largest, each having a small white one in its centre. On the posterior
    wings are two black circular eyes, towards the anal angle; their irides being of a gold colour,
    and the pupils white. The superior wings are a little dentated, the inferior ones being
    angulated.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> All the wings, on this side, are of a very pale brown, marked
    all over with short, crooked, wave-like stripes, of a dark brown colour, almost black. On the
    anterior wings are four eyes, the largest, situated near the middle of the wing, is encircled
    with yellow, its centre being white; below this is a small one, and two other small ones are
    placed near the tips. Posterior wings, with a row of six black eyes near the external edge,
    whereof two are much larger than the rest; the irides of all being yellow, and the pupils white.
    That next the anal angle is sesquialterate. In some specimens these eyes are less distinct than
    in others; in some there are not more than five to be discerned, and only one on each superior
    wing; in others not more than three can be distinguished, the small ones being entirely
    wanting.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">Drury observes (Introd. to vol. iii. p. 16.) that this insect very much resembles a
  species sent by Mr. Smeathman from Africa, which comes out only about sunset, and is then to be
  found in dark shades, wavering about amongst the early flying noctuæ, and other nocturnal species.
  In some manuscripts of the late Professor Weber of Kiel, in my possession, the East Indies are
  given as the habitat of this species.</p>

    The head, thorax, and base of the abdomen dark chocolate brown; the extremity and sides of the
    latter dark. Anterior wings of a fine deep chocolate brown. A narrow, irregular, and oblique
    cream-coloured bar runs across the wing; between this and the tip, from the anterior edge, runs
    another crooked irregular bar, of a much darker colour, reaching almost half across the wing
    towards the interior angle, the external margin being of a lighter shade. Posterior wings,
    having a white bar running transversely across the wing, widening by degrees, and ending at the
    anal angle. Six square orange spots also of different sizes, are placed within the external
    margin of these wings.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> Anterior wings, in the middle, dark chocolate; the tips dark
    fawn colour, lighter next the shoulders. The two irregular bars, on the upper side, are here a
    little broader. Within the external edge are three rather pearly white spots. Posterior wings
    greyish fawn colour, with the <span class="pagenum" id="page30">{30}</span>external edges
    darker. A pale pearl-coloured bar runs across the wing beyond the middle, widening gradually;
    below this are some very faint brown spots, and near the external edge some faint orange ones,
    scarcely visible. The edges of all the wings are entire.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The genus Castnia is another of those curious anomalous forms, which exhibit the
  characters of several groups. The general form of the wings is that of a moth, whilst the
  variegated colours, indicating diurnal flight, and the structure of the antennæ are those of a
  butterfly. It is much to be regretted, that travellers in South America have not ascertained the
  preparatory states of this extraordinary group, which alone will enable us satisfactorily to
  ascertain its real relations.</p>

    dark brown. Abdomen reaching half an inch below the wings of a reddish dun colour. Anterior
    wings dun colour; with a large spot or patch, of a darker colour, situated on the posterior
    margin, near the base. Two indented black lines run obliquely from the anterior edge, near the
    tip, to the posterior near the middle; the space between them being rather lighter than the
    rest. Posterior wings dun colour, immaculate. All the wings, both on the under and upper sides,

  <p class="sp3">This insect, which appears to have been overlooked by modern authors, seems to form
  a connecting link between Zeuzera and Gastropacha, agreeing with the former in the general form,
  and with the latter in the transverse denticulated fasciæ on the anterior wings, and the curved
  antennæ feathered to the tips.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The caterpillar of this fine moth feeds upon the wild American plum (Prunus
  Pensylvanica), garden plum, &amp;c. It is thick and fleshy, of a pale green colour, with a pair of
  small blue spots on each segment, and with two rows of short and setose yellow dorsal tubercles.
  One observed by Abbot, spun up on the 17th of June, and the moth came out on the 30th of March
  following. The cocoon is attached to a twig. The outside web is coarse, and the inner covered with
  silk, like a silk-worm's cocoon. Abbot states that this silk has been carded, spun, and made into
  stockings, and that it will wash like linen. The species is, however, too rare to be of any
  utility in Georgia. It is, however, much more abundant in the neighbourhood of New York, and has
  been bred in England from some brought over in the chrysalis state. It is difficult to rear it in
  confinement.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The caterpillar of this insect is brown, with five pale longitudinal lines, and
  with long hairs arising from fulvous tubercles. It feeds, according to Abbot, upon plantain, corn,
  peas, and many other plants. A specimen observed by this author was hatched on the 23d of July,
  spun up on the 28th of August, and the moth appeared on the 9th of September. It is said
  occasionally to make great devastation among Indian corn. Sir J. E. Smith ascertained the specific
  identity of this insect from Dr. Hunter's Museum, examined by Fabricius, who has neglected to cite
  Drury's figure.</p>

  punctatissima of Abbot and Smith, of which the female is entirely white. The last named species
  feeds upon the mulberry, persimmon, willow, and wild cherry of America. One observed by Abbot spun
  up on the 16th of May, and came out on the 1st of June. The whole brood of caterpillars feed
  together in a web, and will often entirely destroy the leaves of a small tree. The name proposed
  by Drury evidently alludes to the triangular spots on the margin of the anterior wings, and seems
  quite as expressive as that employed by Sir J. E. Smith, who seems to have treated Drury's work on
  several occasions as scarcely deserving of notice.</p>

    spots above them, above which a yellow irregular bar runs across the middle of the wing, having

  the belly rose-coloured, and four rows of pale blue dots. I have reverted to Drury's specific
  name, which has certainly the priority, as appears from the dates which I have introduced amongst
  the synonyms. Dr. Boisduval has given another species of this genus under the name of Palamedes,
  described by Fabricius under that name, but considered by him to be a Nymphalis. This latter
  species must consequently receive a new denomination.</p>

    and orange; in some the dark brown occupying the greater part of the wings, in others the orange
    colour is predominant; but the tips and external edges in all are dark brown; in some two ocelli
    are seen close to the anterior edge, and near the lower corner; but in others these ocelli are
    not to be discovered. Posterior wings dark brown and orange. Round the edge is a waved dark
    border, through which a small waved white line, runs from the anal angle about half way; above
    this are placed, in a row, five round ocelli, and one oblong, next the anal angle; the pupils

    that part. Posterior wings very pale clay-coloured, with a cloud on the middle of the external

    below the shoulders. Several oval and oblong yellow spots are placed between the tips and this
    bar. One also is situated close above it, near the middle of the wing; being separated from it
    by the tendon, which is black. Below the bar are four small spots, beginning at the interior
    angle (the first being double). Posterior wings furnished with two black tails, having a long

    of yellow above it, whose upper side resembles a row of arches. Above this is an irregular black
    bar, running from the anterior edges, across the wings, with two small scarlet streaks at the
    anal angles. On this bar is a row of blue crescents, answering to and placed just above the
    arch-like bar before-mentioned; and in the centre is a faint mark of scarlet.</p>

    in the anterior wings, rises a stripe of sea-green, which crosses the inferior ones; and,
    running parallel with the abdominal margin, ends near the extremity of the body. A little below
    this is a small scarlet spot, placed near the anal angle; with two smaller spots, of a green

    than the first, begins at the posterior edge of the anterior wings, and crosses the inferior
    ones, parallel with the first, being continued a little lower. On the anterior wings, about the
    middle of the anterior edge, rises a bar, of a fine sea-green colour, which crossing both wings,
    terminates at the middle of the posterior, being narrowest at each end. A row of eight white
    spots runs parallel with the external edge, ending at the lower corner. Near the external edges

    the anterior; and the green marks and stripes are rather larger here, than on the upper side.
    The scarlet spot, on the abdominal edge, is considerably larger on this side. A scarlet stripe
    also begins on the anterior edge, and fills completely the space between the broad green bar and
    the second stripe, mentioned above, extending as low as the extremity of the body. The two

  the figure does not agree with the description given by that author, who describes the fourth pale
  fascia as "bifide dans la cellule discoidale des premières ailes." The exact uniformity in the
  shape of this fascia, in both of Drury's figures, renders its correctness evident, and
  consequently the insect figured by Drury must be regarded as a variety of the species described by
  Boisduval.</p>

    <p><i>Upper Side.</i> Antennæ brown, and strongly pectinated. The head white, small, and almost
    hid under the shoulders and neck, having a small brown ring encircling it. Thorax pale yellow,
    having a chocolate or dark brown line crossing it, parallel with the margins of the anterior
    wings. All the wings are of a beautiful pea-green colour; the nerves being of a pale red brown.
    Along the anterior margin of the anterior wings runs a chocolate line, which is narrowed towards
    the tips. About an inch from the shoulders springs from this line a small curved one, which,
    bending towards the middle of the wing, terminates in a small eye, pointed in the lower part,
    whose pupil is transparent like glass; the iris being partly red and partly black, within which
    are semicircles of white; external margin of the wings, red brown; the posterior being white.
    Posterior wings furnished with two broad tails, which, at their extremities, appear as if they
    were crimped; their external edges being red brown. In the middle of each of these wings is
    likewise an eye, similar to, but rather larger than those in the anterior ones. Abdomen
    white.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> Abdomen white, the sides being of a dark clay colour. All the
    wings are of the same colour as on the upper side; the nerves being browner and more
    conspicuous, without the brown edge on the anterior pair; the eyes themselves are the same as on
    that side. The anterior margin of the inferior wings is white, and the eyes strongly resemble
    those of an animal having them half shut.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Drury's correspondent informed him that the caterpillar of this handsome moth is
  red, and feeds on the leaves of the sassafras tree. When they are full-fed they inclose themselves
  in a strong case composed of the substance of the tree, and a glutinous matter which they secrete.
  They appear in June and August. The caterpillar, however, figured by Abbot is green, with short
  hairs scattered over the body, and with about eight small red <span class="pagenum"
  id="page46">{46}</span>spots on each segment, placed transversely. This author also states that it
  feeds upon the sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua, Linn.), different kinds of walnut, and the
  Persimon (Diospyros Virginiana). One of them spun up on the 31st of May, and came out on the 8th
  of June; another on the 23rd of June, and came out on the 10th of July; and a third, which did not
  spin up until the 6th of September, remained in the chrysalis till the 3rd of March. It continues
  breeding throughout the summer, but is not very plentiful.</p>

  </div>

  <p>According to Abbot the caterpillar is pale green, with white lateral oblique stripes, and a
  pink tail. It is said to feed on the potato, tobacco, red pepper (Capsicum?), &amp;c. One of these
  caterpillars, observed by Abbot, went into the ground on the 19th of June, and came out on the
  15th of July; whilst another went in on the 8th of July, and came out <span class="pagenum"
  id="page48">{48}</span>on the 1st of August. The caterpillar is stated by the same author to be
  very destructive in plantations of tobacco, the cultivators being obliged to pick them carefully
  off the young plants. The chrysalis is of a chesnut colour, with a long nearly straight tongue
  case, extending to the middle of the breast, and clubbed at the end. The moth is generally seen in
  an evening, sucking the James-town weed and gourd blossoms, and continues breeding all the summer;
  the moth is common in the West Indies, as well as in Georgia and Carolina. Dr. Brown says it is
  called the musquito hawk, from its appearing at that time of the evening when those insects
  abound, and being vulgarly but erroneously supposed to prey upon them. <i>Abbot and Smith, loc.
  cit.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Specimens of this American insect have from time to time been captured in this
  country. "It unquestionably cannot," however observes Mr. Stephens, "be considered as indigenous,
  and ought to be rigidly excluded from our cabinets; otherwise the most perplexing consequences
  must inevitably arise, to the total confusion of our inquiries into the geographical distribution
  of insects. If this be admitted, as well might 'the noble monarch of the forest,' because a
  captive lioness which had escaped from her prison was retaken on Salisbury Plain."</p>

  <p>The caterpillar of this insect, according to Abbot and Smith, is brown, with four dorsal dark
  flesh-coloured lines, and a series of short lateral oblique cream-coloured marks united together
  over the legs. It feeds upon the sweet potatoe plant (Convolvulus Batatas, Linn.), and is
  sometimes frequent though the moth is rare. The chrysalis is chesnut, with a long curved tongue
  case, the extremity of which is recurved. It is often dug up with the potatoes. In Virginia one of
  these insects buried itself October 3rd, and came forth in the perfect state on the 30th of May;
  whilst one observed in Georgia went into the ground on the 20th of August, and came out the 11th
  of September.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This species was considered by Drury and Smith as a climatal variety of the
  Europæan Sphinx Convolvuli. Fabricius, however, considered it distinct, and designated it by the
  specific name adopted above.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect is attached to the pine, and is consequently found in the great forests
  in Germany, and other parts of Continental Europe. This accounts for its scarcity in England, and
  for its having been occasionally found in the pine forests of Scotland by Dr. Leach and Mr.
  Wilson. The larva is described by Mr. Stephens as being entirely yellow in its first skin, in the
  second green with yellow stripes, in the third deeper green, with three longitudinal lemon-yellow
  lines on each side, and finally of a rich green with a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page54">{54}</span>brown dorsal line; the sides with two deep yellow ones; the anterior and
  first segment of the body yellow, the latter spotted with black; the horn, which was previously
  straight, becomes curved and black. It feeds on various species of pine, as Pinus abies,
  sylvestris, Strobus, &amp;c. The chrysalis is dark brown, changing to maroon; the tongue-sheath is
  short.</p>

    continues to the shoulder margin, the other terminates at the middle of the posterior margin; on

  numerous slender transverse black lines, and white oblique lateral marks <i>directed towards the
  head</i>. Its food is very various. One, observed by Abbot, went into the ground on the 14th of
  August, and came out on the 7th of September; whilst another which went in on the 29th of
  September, did not come out until the 18th of July following. The moth is rare; but may
  occasionally be seen sucking the gourd blossoms in the evening. The chrysalis has a pointed tail,
  but is destitute of a porrected tongue-case.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The caterpillar of this hawk-moth was found by Abbot on the Virginian Creeper. It
  went into the ground on the 18th of August, and the fly came out on the 11th of September. The
  tail of the male spreads like a fan. This is a very rare species; one was caught in the evening on
  a gourd blossom. It flew exceedingly swift, making a noise like a humble bee. The caterpillar is
  of a very pale greenish colour, with two dark dorsal lines, terminating at the base of the
  straight tail; the sides of the body are also ornamented with pale yellow oblique stripes,
  margined with brown. The chrysalis is chesnut, with a short point at the extremity of the body,
  and without any tongue-case.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Since the days of Drury this handsome insect has been ascertained to be a native of
  our island. It has, however, until lately been deemed one of the rarest as well as most beautiful
  species in the rare family to which it belongs. Entomologists are indebted not only for a
  considerable number of specimens, but, what is more interesting, for a knowledge of the habits of
  the insect to William Raddon, Esq. the celebrated engraver, by whom an interesting notice has been
  published in the Entomological Magazine. It feeds upon the sea <span class="pagenum"
  id="page59">{59}</span>spurge (Euphorbia paralias), which grows in plenty on the sand hills in the
  neighbourhood of Barnstaple and Braunton Burrows, in Devonshire. These sand hills are of great
  extent, and, as suggested by Mr. Curtis, must have been collected by the winds and storms to which
  they are constantly exposed. During the winter the whole soil is frequently removed, so as
  completely to alter the surface of the country; a great number of the pupæ must consequently be
  destroyed or buried at a considerable distance below the surface, where probably they lie hid
  until they are brought to light and life by the influence of the elements. These circumstances
  account for the great irregularity in the appearance of the insects. In 1814, for instance, they
  were so plentiful that Mr. Raddon found not less than one hundred minute larvæ upon an armful of
  spurge, which he had cut at dusk the preceding evening. The rarity of the insect is also increased
  by the difficulty of rearing it. The late Mr. Fuseli, the royal academician, who was a zealous
  entomologist, was enabled only to obtain one moth from twenty chrysalides. The larvæ are full
  grown in September, and the moth appears in the following June.</p>

    <p><i>Male.</i> Black, except the elytra, which are of an olive colour; having a number of black
    spots on them of different shapes and sizes, varying considerably in different individuals.
    Thorax, above, smooth, and shining, the sides covered with a multitude of small punctures. Its
    front is produced into a long shining horn, near three inches in length, which gradually bends
    downwards from the base to the extremity, where it is slightly forked; the under side being
    covered with short fine hairs of a yellowish colour, resembling the pile of velvet, and having
    about two inches from its extremity a strong short spine placed on each side. The head is
    furnished with another horn, about two-thirds the length of the first, sharp and thin on its
    upper side, and towards the end bending upwards; having on the upper edge, near the middle,
    three or four teeth or strong spines, and another near the extremity. Eyes shining, red brown.
    Tibiæ armed with spines, particularly the anterior pair, which have four; three near the tips,
    and one near the middle. The middle and hinder tibiæ have each two strong spurs, and several
    smaller spines, surrounded with hair on the other parts. The edge of the abdomen is covered with
    a row of dark orange-coloured hairs. Several other parts of the body, joints, &amp;c. are also
    clothed with the same <span class="pagenum" id="page60">{60}</span>coloured hairs. Each of the
    ungues has a little tuft of strong hairs issuing from the extremity of the terminal joint of the
    tarsi.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Female.</i> This sex is unfurnished with horns. The elytra are the same colour
    as in the male, not spotted so much, if at all, and more rugose. Thorax black, with a few
    yellowish spots, formed like stars or rays on it. In other respects it resembles the male.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Drury adds to this insect the following remark&mdash;"I have observed many species of beetles
  whose males have been furnished with horns, either on the head or thorax, but in which the females
  have none, but have those parts quite smooth and plain; and my observations incline me strongly to
  think that this rule subsists in every one of them, through the whole class. The instances I could
  bring in support of this opinion are too many to be admitted in this place."</p>

  <p>The circumstance observed upon in the preceding note is certainly very interesting in a
  physiological point of view. In quadrupeds we find both sexes of cornuted species armed with
  horns; but in insects almost universally the males alone are provided with these appendages. It is
  also worthy of remark, that although in the majority of insects the females considerably surpass
  the males in size, yet in those species in which the males are cornuted, the females are almost
  invariably smaller than their partners.</p>

  <p>Burmeister lays it down as a rule, that with regard to the differences of the sexes, their
  whole character may be thus distinguished; viz. that the male displays a preponderance of
  evolution, and the female a preponderance of involution; and observes, "that some beetles have
  processes upon the head and thorax, which, like the mandibles, can meet, like tongs, and thus
  serve as a weapon. This is asserted of Hercules and its large comrades." This opinion as to the
  uses of these horns can, however, scarcely be maintained, since the number of species in which the
  horns really meet is very few. Kirby and Spence observe, "What may be the use of these
  extraordinary appendages to the males, has not yet been ascertained. Whether the individuals of
  this sex are more exposed to the attack of birds and other enemies, in consequence of being more
  on the wing than the females, and are therefore thus provided with numerous projecting points of
  defence, is a question worth considering." It is also to be observed that these appendages,
  instead of being deciduous, as in many of the higher animals, are in insects component parts of
  the external skeleton.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There are a few exceptions to the observation of Drury; thus in the Lamellicorn
  genus Hoplites Dej. Catal. (Scarabæus Pan,) the females are cornuted as well as the males; and in
  the genus Osmia, belonging to the section of wild bees, Dasygastres, Latr., the females alone have
  the head furnished with two porrected horns.</p>

    <p class="sp0">Head, above, flesh-coloured; beneath, black; about three-fourths of an inch in
    length, terminating in two blunt, obtuse, and irregular horns. Two other thick and jagged horns
    also arise from its sides, much shorter than the former. Its breadth at the base is half an
    inch; having a small projecting ridge running along the middle, from thence to the extremity, at
    the base of the horns. Thorax an inch and a half long, being principally black; but along the
    sides is flesh-coloured. It has also five narrow and irregular waved lines of a flesh colour
    running from the anterior to the posterior edges; one of which, being in the middle of the
    thorax, is narrower than the rest; the two next this terminate at the posterior edges in a fine
    rose colour; these next the lateral edges are broadest, having likewise a patch of rose colour
    next the wing-cases. About the middle of the thorax, these external lines separate and divide,
    continuing so almost to the anterior edges, where they again unite. The under part of the thorax
    is flesh colour; but in the middle of a yellowish brown. The scutellum is triangular and black;
    with a clear white central oblong mark truncated in front. Elytra beautiful chocolate-coloured,
    and <span class="pagenum" id="page62">{62}</span>covered with a great number of short fine
    hairs, resembling the pile on velvet; the anterior part, with a narrow and indented margin, of a
    cream colour, also surrounding the scutellum. The elytra are two inches broad at the base. Legs
    very dark green colour, almost black. Intermediate and posterior femora and tibiæ with dark
    yellow hairs. Abdomen very dark green, furnished on the sides and edge with dark yellow hairs.
    Sternum rather long.</p>

  <p>This magnificent insect may be regarded as one of the rarest species figured in these
  Illustrations. Drury states, that the specimen here represented was brought from Africa by Mr.
  Ogilvie, surgeon of His Majesty's ship the Renown, being found floating, dead, in the river
  Gaboon, opposite Prince's Island, near the equinoctial line. Nearly seventy years have elapsed
  since the insect was first described, and yet the insect remains, as far as my knowledge extends,
  unique.<a id="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> It would appear that the specimen either
  belonged to or passed into the hands of Dr. Hunter after the death of Mr. Drury, for Fabricius
  describes the species with a citation of the museum of Dr. Hunter alone; and Olivier's figure was
  taken from the specimen whilst it was in that gentleman's possession. After his decease it passed,
  with his collection, by bequest, into the possession of the University of Glasgow, where it now
  forms one of the most interesting objects in the Hunterian Museum. Joseph Hooker, Esq., son of Sir
  W. Hooker, the highly distinguished botanist of Glasgow, tells me that the individual in question
  was picked up by a sailor in the river above mentioned, and that it is stated in the MSS. of Dr.
  Hunter that it cost Mr. Drury £10. In the Catalogue of the Insects of Mr. Drury, which were sold
  by auction at the Natural History Sale Rooms in King Street, Covent Garden (now occupied by Mr. J.
  C. Stevens), on the 23rd of May, 1805, and two following days, the 95th lot is described as
  "Scarabæus Goliathus, <i>var.</i>" Whence it would appear that the insect here figured was not in
  the possession of Mr. Drury at his decease, and that he only possessed the insect figured in the
  3rd volume of these Illustrations, pl. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47601/47601-h/47601-h.htm#plate40">40</a>,
  which evidently on the authority of Fabricius he had regarded as a variety only of the specimen
  here figured.</p>

  <p>The genus Goliathus is exceedingly interesting, not only on account of the gigantic size and
  singular form of the species of which it is composed, but also from the geographical range of the
  group. Mr. Kirby observes upon this subject, "Mr. W. S. MacLeay has remarked to me that Goliathus
  Lam. appears to belt the globe, but not under one form. The types of the genus are the vast
  African Goliaths (G. giganteus, &amp;c.), which, as well as G. Polyphemus, and another brought
  from Java by Dr. Horsfield, have, like Cetonia, the scapulars interposed between the posterior
  angles of the prothorax and the shoulders of the elytra, while the South American species (G.
  micans,<a id="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> &amp;c.) have not this projection of the
  scapulars; in this resembling Trichius; Mr. MacLeay further observes, that the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page63">{63}</span>female of the Javanese Goliathus is exactly a Cetonia,
  while that of the Brazilian is a Trichius."&mdash;<i>Introd. to Entomology</i>, vol. 4. p.
  494.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Since the publication of this passage, the genus Goliathus has undergone a
  considerable revision; the South American species, Cetonia Ynca, <i>Fabr.</i> barbicornis,
  <i>MacLeay</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, have been separated from the genus by Saint Fargeau and Serville
  in the Encyclopédie Méthodique, under the generic name of Ynca, and the Javanese species above
  noticed (Gol. Rhinophyllus<a id="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> <i>Wiedemann</i>) is
  stated by Latreille in the Règne Animal, 2nd edition, not to belong to the genus Goliathus, but to
  that of Cetonia. The genus is thus restricted to the African species,<a id="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> with the exception of a Mexican insect which Dejean has named
  Goliathus Hoffneri. The genus Ynca may thus be regarded rather as a geographical subgenus, or type
  of form belonging to and representing the African species of Goliathus.</p>

  <p class="sp4">This insect has been introduced into the list of British species on the authority
  of the late Mr. Haworth, who recorded the fact of a living specimen having been taken by a
  bricklayer amongst old timber, on pulling down the roof of a building at Chelsea, (Entom. Trans,
  vol. i. p. 76.) Mr. Stephens, however, (loc. supra citat.) thinks it very doubtful whether the
  species be really indigenous, as it appears highly probable that the specimen above alluded to,
  may have been imported amongst some of the Continental plants which abound in the above vicinity,
  the insect occurring very copiously in rotten bark, the refuse of conservatories, and putrid wood
  in various parts of the Continent.</p>

  <p>The advantages resulting from the modern method of investigation adopted in Natural History in
  general, and especially in Entomology, are no where more conspicuous than in the case of the
  present species of dung-rolling beetles or <i>pillularii</i>, as they were aptly termed by Pliny
  and other old writers; the present species inhabiting North America, having been long confounded
  with an inhabitant of Southern Europe, which indeed possesses a similarity in general appearance
  and habits, but belongs to a distinct genus. Linnæus applied the term pilularius specifically to
  the species inhabiting Italy and Spain; referring, however, to Catesby's Carolina, pl. 11., so
  that it is evident that this writer had never seen the North American insect. Schonher however
  remarks, "scarabæus pillularius Linn. pertinet ad At. volvens Fabr;"<a id="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> whilst Fabricius, although quoting Drury and De Geer (who both
  figure the North American species) has increased the confusion by giving Southern Europe as its
  habitat. Under these circumstances I have done our author the justice to revert to his specific
  name; his being certainly the earliest systematic specific reference to the American species,
  which may be distinguished from the European one by the following particulars<span

  published some observations, in order to prove the specific distinctness of this and two other
  species with which it is generally regarded as identical. Its habits are different from those of
  the other Trichii; being generally found upon flowers, a peculiarity, with which its hirsute body
  and bee-like appearance apparently offer some indicatorial connexions. It is extremely rare in

  <p>The larva of this beetle is a great fleshy grub, which lives in the stumps of tree. It is eaten
  by many persons, by whom it is considered a great dainty. The perfect insect is called by the
  natives the macokko beetle. The following observations, published by Mr. Drury in the introduction
  to his third volume, will be read with interest from the spirit of practical utility in which they
  are written.</p>

  <p>"The larvæ or caterpillars, not only of this but of all the beetles that feed on decayed wood,
  seem to be rich and delicate eating, particularly those of the Curculio palmarum (vid. Linn. Syst.
  Nat. p. 606. 1.), and in general all those of the Cerambyces. So that every forest in the torrid
  zone affords a man plenty of very wholesome and hearty nourishment, who has an instrument strong
  enough to cut in pieces the decayed trees. This knowledge might have saved the lives perhaps of
  many seamen who have been shipwrecked on desert equinoctial shores, which are generally covered
  with thick woods. Mr. Smeathman has met with many maritime people, who, by living on a scanty
  allowance of unripe fruits, crude roots, coarse seeds, nuts, and other trash, after a shipwreck,
  or in other cases of distress so frequent with people in the African trade, have made themselves
  exceeding sick, and much increased their hardships, which by means of these caterpillars only,
  might have been greatly alleviated. The very best kind of vegetable food is but poor nourishment
  for the labouring Europeans, if not accompanied with animal flesh, or at least with animal or
  vegetable oils; and such foods as seamen in distress meet with, as above mentioned, have
  oftentimes very acrimonious qualities, and are dangerous even in small quantities to those who eat
  them at intervals, either out of mere curiosity or to gratify their appetites; while these kinds
  of insect foods, abounding with a very rich and delicious oil, are consequently the most wholesome
  and nutritious which men in the situation above described could possibly procure, requiring no
  other preparation than roasting in any manner. (See Philosophical Transactions.) To this kind of
  food may be added that of the termites and locusts in general among the insect tribes, which are
  not only wholesome to all, but palatable to many. At any rate they are sufficient to support life;
  and the knowledge of such a resource universally extended, might in many instances be the means of
  saving the lives of adventurers to distant climes. Besides these means of subsistence, if the
  botanists could point out a plain and obvious method for men in general to distinguish the noxious
  roots and herbs from those which are edible, men thrown on any thing but mere rocks and sandbanks
  would readily find subsistence, the kind hand of nature being extended all over the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page82">{82}</span>surface of our globe to every one who will accept the
  friendly invitation, and use the means she has with such a motherly tenderness offered for our
  benefit and support.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"Mr. Smeathman has assured me, that in clearing the ground in Africa he has found
  great quantities of roots of the yam and potatoe kind (Convolvulus Batatas), that grew
  spontaneously, and which the slaves from distant interior regions knew exceedingly well, and
  sought for with great avidity. He lived near two years in Africa before he found that the most
  excellent greens for boiling grew wild in every open glade of the island, and even close to his
  very door. I mention these things because they are all within the power of men in the most naked,
  unarmed, and unprepared situation, and require neither fire-arms or other powerful apparatus to
  obtain them; and shew that in these cases, as well as many others, the study of natural history is
  of no small importance to mankind, since it may not only promote trade, arts, and sciences, but be
  conducive to the immediate happiness and safety of men's lives."</p>

  <p class="sp3">This very common Chinese insect has been confounded by Fabricius, &amp;c. with an

  Java (Tesseratoma Javana, Klug. Burm. 2. 350. figured by Stoll. t. 1. fig. 2.) As, however,
  Drury's specific name, as applied to the Chinese species, has the priority in point of date, I
  have here reverted to it, and would apply a new specific name to the species from Sierra Leone.
  The Fabrician species belongs to a different section of the genus having the terminal joint of the
  antennæ elongated. The only specimens which I have seen of it are those contained in the Banksian
  Collection in the possession of the Linnæan Society of London. Wolff figures the Chinese species.
  I have little doubt that Donovan's figure is intended to represent the true papillosus, although
  it is given as an inhabitant of India.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This insect very closely resembles the common English species Ichneumon luteus, Linn. It is,
  however, considerably larger.</p>

  <p>After describing this insect our author took occasion to enter into the natural history of the
  family to which it belongs, namely, the Ichneumonidæ, so named from the Linnæan genus Ichneumon,
  which last he says, "appears to be taken from its nature and way of life." He then proceeds as
  follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"It is generally known that butterflies are produced from caterpillars, and that these
  caterpillars put on different forms before they arrive to that of the butterfly; but few persons
  know, who have not engaged in this study, that the bodies of these caterpillars are receptacles or
  habitations for lesser insects, that live and grow within them during a certain time; where they
  are nourished and fed by the juices of their bowels, till they arrive to a mature age; when, by
  the appointment of nature, they kill their fosterers, being totally unable to live on any other
  kind of food but what the intestines of these animals supply them with. The uses and advantages
  accruing to mankind by the institution of such a genus of insects, together with their natural
  history, are the subject of the following lines.</p>

  <p>"If we examine the glorious works of the creation, and reflect on the paternal care and wisdom
  of the Almighty, displayed in the preservation and increase of all ranks and kinds of animals;
  that even the most direful and noxious, have such a proportion in the scale of life, as is most
  agreeable to the ends of His divine providence; that the limits He hath prescribed to each, extend
  so far and no farther; and that each species shall multiply in such abundance or scarcity, as are
  best adapted to preserve, by a just equilibrium, the harmony of the universe: When, I say, we
  behold this, the mind can scarcely forbear crying out, under a rapturous sense of conviction,
  "every thing is good." It is to this end we see the strong are permitted to prey on the weak; and
  that the number of the latter increase in a proportion sufficient to supply the wants of the
  former; it is to this end we see some feed on herbs and plants, some on fruits and seeds, and some
  on flesh; each being furnished with appetites and powers, suited to their respective ways of life:
  and it is to this end, we see those of the most minute kinds, abounding in a degree far beyond
  those of the first magnitude. The knowledge of the insect kingdom illustrates this observation
  beyond all possibility of doubt; and the number that may be bred from a single pair, in many
  species, would exceed all credibility, if it was not to be proved by any person who <span
  class="pagenum" id="page94">{94}</span>would take the trouble. The wonderful increase that only
  two summers would be capable of producing among many of them, if each egg was to yield its
  respective insect, is amazing. The world itself, in a few years, would be incapable of affording
  plants sufficient for the nourishment of one single species.<a id="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Hence will appear the 'loving kindness' of the Almighty, in setting such bounds, and keeping
  them within such limits as best answers the purpose for which He created them; and hence appears
  the necessity of their becoming food to other animals. Birds, fishes, and the smaller kinds of
  beasts, are at eternal war with them; but as all these would be insufficient of themselves to
  restrain and prevent them from multiplying too fast, other kinds of beings are instituted for this
  end, whose existence depends on their destruction. Of these, the species of insect I am
  describing, is the most singular, of which (genus) there are several sorts, differing greatly in
  size and shape. Some are furnished with three setæ or bristles at the extremity of their bodies,
  the middle one being a hollow tube, secured or fenced by the outer ones, through which they eject
  their eggs, after they have penetrated the body of the caterpillar they settle on. Some appear to
  have no bristles, others have them bent close under their bodies, and are not to be seen, unless
  closely examined. As their whole business appears to be the destroying the caterpillars of the
  butterfly and moth tribes, they are indefatigable in the pursuit of them; but as this is confined
  to the pregnant females, they are observed ranging about continually in search of the proper
  subjects to lay their eggs on; flying on every bush, and running with unwearied diligence on every
  twig, till they have arrived to the place where the scent of the caterpillar soon furnishes them
  with the certainty of its being there. Having thus discovered the animal it was in quest of, the
  Ichneumon immediately settles on it, with an intent to discharge its eggs; but the caterpillar
  being sensible, from a natural instinct, of its enemy's assault, bends its head backwards to the
  place where it feels itself attacked, and endeavours by various means, either by striking its head
  violently against the part, falling to the ground, or by some sudden contortion, to disengage
  itself: but this seldom happens, unless the Ichneumon is feeble, and unable to withstand the
  shocks of the caterpillar; in which case they will frequently relinquish their attack, and seek
  out some other subject, whose resistance they are more capable of encountering. On the other hand,
  if the Ichneumon is strong enough to withstand the efforts of the caterpillar, it either lays its
  eggs on the outside of the skin, as is the nature of some to do, or else perforates the body with
  the bristle before described, and immediately discharges an egg. Some of these Ichneumons quit the
  caterpillar upon the emission of an egg, but others <span class="pagenum"
  id="page95">{95}</span>continue thereon till they have emitted them all; which sometimes is more
  than an hundred. It is necessary to observe, that many caterpillars of moths and butterflies (the
  former more especially) are infested by a particular species of these Ichneumons, that confine
  themselves entirely to them alone, and never, that we know of, attack any other. Thus that of the
  Privet Hawk or Sphinx Ligustri of Linnæus, that of the Elephant Hawk or Sphinx Elpenor of the same
  author, &amp;c. are always found to yield particular kinds of Ichneumons. Others, indeed, attack
  any kind of caterpillar belonging to the farinaceous-winged tribe; and, as I observed above, if
  not too powerful and strong for them, will there deposit their eggs.</p>

  <p>"If the egg is laid on the body of the caterpillar, and not within it, a few days, by the
  warmth of the sun, ripens it to maturity; and then the young destroyer, directed by nature, eats
  its passage through the under-side of the egg, and passes into the body of the caterpillar, but if
  the egg is discharged into its body, it there ripens, unseen, to maturity. In either case, it
  lives on the substance or juices of its intestines; thriving and increasing in bulk, in a
  proportion equal to the creature it is doomed to kill. The caterpillar, also, notwithstanding its
  having thus received the means of a slow but certain death, increases in size, and, to outward
  appearance, in health; arriving to the period when it is to undergo its metamorphosis, and become
  a Chrysalis, in as much strength and vigour as any other of the species: but when the time arrives
  for its enlargement into its complete state, and to become a moth or butterfly, the Ichneumon
  makes its appearance; having arrived to its time of completion within the body of its supporter,
  and exhausted its juices by the nourishment drawn from it, leaving behind it a dry empty shell, in
  the form of a chrysalis.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"In this manner many of these Ichneumons exist. Others, when arrived to maturity,
  having lived within the bodies of the caterpillars, as described, eat their way out through its
  sides, and, crawling to a small distance, form round themselves cases of a substance like silk;
  wherein, having lain a few days, they quit their prisons in the shape of very small flies, some
  having two wings, others four."&mdash;Vide Goedartius, Albin, Wilks, Harris, &amp;c.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The following particulars relative to the economy of this species were communicated to Mr.
  Drury from a correspondent in Antigua, who forwarded to him specimens of the insect.</p>

  <p>"This insect is called at Antigua, and several other places in the West Indies, the Mason Fly,
  a name given it from the remarkable manner in which it builds its nest, or receptacle for its
  young.</p>

  <p>"When the male and female have performed the business of copulation, their<a id="NtA_30"
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> next care is to provide a proper habitation for raising and
  securing their future progeny; to this end they seek out a proper spot that is secure from rains,
  &amp;c. and is so situated as to afford a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page100">{100}</span>sufficient warmth for the young offspring, but not so hot as to destroy
  instead of nourishing them. The sides of a wall underneath the eaves of a house, is the place
  often pitched on for this purpose. Thus prompted by nature, and instinctively knowing the
  necessity of performing this work, they carry a quantity of dirt, and place it against the wall,
  which they temper and soften with a liquor issuing from their bodies, that renders it sufficiently
  strong and tenacious, and when dry, is proof against any rains that may happen to get at it. The
  nest is composed generally of about a dozen cells, that are round, and sufficiently capacious to
  hold the caterpillar when grown to its full size; each of which is about an inch long, and about
  three-eighths of an inch in diameter, lying parallel with each other, and formed in such a manner,
  that each cell lies between two others, both above and below it, except the outward ones, having a
  hole left open at the extremity of each, for the parents to go in and out at pleasure. See Plate
  <a href="#plate45">45</a>. Fig. 8. that at 9 being a nest supposed to be cut through its middle,
  to shew the form of the cells, and manner of their being built. The industry exerted on this
  occasion is remarkably great, for in a few days the whole is completed. There is no doubt but the
  heat of the climate greatly contributes to facilitate this work, as the dirt of which it is
  composed is quickly dried, and by that means enables them to be very expeditious. Their next
  employment is procuring a number of small spiders, with which each cell is properly filled, and
  are to serve for food to the young brood; of these they always take care to lay in such a
  sufficient store, that the young ones seldom, if ever, perish from want. I have opened many of
  these cells, and constantly found a spider remaining uneat, sometimes two, and not seldom three,
  so that it is evident the parent animal makes ample provision for the appetite of its young. By
  the time one cell is replenished with provision, the pregnant female, finding the eggs within her
  ripening to maturity, and under the necessity of discharging them, lays a single one in the cell,
  and then covers up the hole with dirt, which was left open for a passage, in so neat and curious a
  manner, that the nicest eye could not discover the place where they used to enter. She then
  proceeds in the same manner to the next, and so on, till all her eggs are emitted and laid in
  their respective cells, each cell being furnished with a single egg and no more. My correspondent
  assures me, he is not certain whether the male assists in building the nest, or whether it is the
  sole production of the female; but they both equally contribute to furnish it with provision,
  which they carefully watch and preserve from the ants, that in that hot climate would soon rob
  them of. In a little time the young ones are hatched; and each, finding in its respective
  habitation a proper quantity of food, subsists thereon, and there lives unseen, till it arrives to
  its complete state. When it (the caterpillar) is advanced to its full size, it forms round itself
  a brown case, as appears at Fig. 7. Plate <a href="#plate44">44</a>. and at Fig. 10. Plate <a
  href="#plate45">45</a>. and in that inclosure undergoes its transformation; when it puts on its
  form as at Fig. 8. Plate <a href="#plate44">44</a>. remaining with its legs, wings, and horns,
  closed round, as is there shewn, till it has acquired strength to break its enclosure. At its
  first assuming this form, it is white, soft, and tender, and its wings shorter than those in the
  figure; in a few weeks its becomes hard, strong, and of its proper <span class="pagenum"
  id="page101">{101}</span>colour. The wings, also, before that time, grow to their proper size; and
  now, finding itself arrived at a period when the forementioned circumstance of its confinement is
  no longer necessary to its well being, it obtains its liberty, by making a hole at the end of its
  cell, with its jaws and fore legs, large enough to permit its escape.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"The separation of the thorax and abdomen, by such a long slender membrane or
  ligament, is very singular, and the power the insect is invested with, by means of those jaws or
  forceps placed at its mouth, is really wonderful; for the number of insects, of a superior
  strength, as well as size, which it is capable of destroying, is scarcely credible. It will
  overcome a spider of twice its own size, if it can but get upon the back of it, by means of its
  forceps and sting: nor will multitudes of other insects find it a less formidable enemy, if they
  are not guarded by nature with a covering too hard to yield to the force of these destructive
  weapons. In short, it seems to be an animal formed by nature, as one of those instruments
  instituted for subduing and lessening the vast numbers of small insects that abound in warm
  climates."</p>

  seen the present species, but from the admirable accuracy of Moses Harris (by whom the figures
  were drawn) it is evident that the neuration of the wings of this species is identical with that
  of Myrmeleon, agreeing especially with the insect represented at Fig. 4. of this plate, and
  exhibiting the irregular longitudinal nerve below the subcostal nerve and the strong furcate nerve
  running along the middle of the wing; whilst, at the same time, the neuration is quite unlike that
  of Fig. 3. Hence I have no hesitation in placing this insect in the family Myrmeleonidæ. It
  however disagrees with the genera of which that family is composed, viz. Myrmeleon, Linn.
  (Myrmecoleon, Burm.) Ascalaphus, Fabr. and Nymphes, Leach, in having bipectinated antennæ, so that
  I have been compelled to establish a new genus for its reception. Can it be possible that,
  according to the not uncommon practice of the time, the specimen had been mended, and that
  pectinated antennæ had been substituted in the stead of the ordinary ones of a Myrmeleon?</p>

  the paleness of the present species it is evident that the transverse nerves connecting the

  <p class="ac">LIBELLULIDÆ, Pl. <a href="#plate47">47</a> &amp; <a href="#plate48">48</a>.</p>

  <p>All the insects represented in these two plates belong to the genus Libellula of Linnæus, or
  the family of Dragon-flies, Libellulidæ. When the original edition of this work was published,
  there was no English work in which the natural history and curious transformations of this tribe
  of insects were detailed. Our author, therefore, in order to supply the deficiency, published the
  following interesting series of observations upon the subject<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"As I have not met with any English author who has given the natural history of the insects
  delineated in these two plates, I shall make no apology for its introduction; <span
  class="pagenum" id="page107">{107}</span>the frequent opportunities I have had of observing their
  mode of life and action, together with the many singular circumstances observable in both, being
  motives for its publication too powerful to be resisted.</p>

  <p>"It is not easy to determine whether they should be ranked among the water insects, or those of
  the land, nor shall I attempt here to ascertain it; my present business being only to relate the
  several circumstances attending them during their respective states in which they are passing from
  the egg to the complete animal: and although these observations have been confined to our English
  ones, yet they so exactly agree and coincide with those of foreign countries, (as my
  correspondents have assured me), that their nature and behaviour appear to be just the same; so
  that what is observable in ours, is at the same time applicable to the whole genus wherever
  found.</p>

  <p>"If we take a cursory view of the different ranks of animals that inhabit our globe, we shall
  hardly find one that can excite our wonder and astonishment more than this genus; nor is it from
  that general ignorance of the insect world, that reigns so strongly in these kingdoms, that I am
  emboldened to say this; but if we reflect that the beasts, birds, and reptiles are furnished with
  powers for living only in the air, and that even the amphibious tribes can perform the office of
  respiration only in that element: if we also consider that fishes, on the contrary, are unable to
  respire but in water, and when deprived of that must certainly perish, we cannot but conclude that
  all these animals are most wisely fitted with means and faculties for filling up the respective
  orders and ranks wherein they are placed. But let us cast our eyes on the subjects I am about to
  describe, and there behold a tribe of beings, who, as soon as they leave their eggs, subsist for a
  certain number of months, (I had almost said years), creeping and swimming in the liquid element;
  are there invested with organs and powers for existing and weathering out the utmost severity and
  intemperance of the winter; that afterwards as the spring and summer advances, and the period
  arrives when they are to appear in other forms, in the space of about half an hour those very
  organs and powers that before enabled them to live under water should be so entirely altered, the
  very natures and abilities of the creatures so changed as to permit them to quit their former
  element and place of residence, insomuch that all the remaining part of their lives is spent in
  the open air, furnished with wings, and flying about in the full glee of wanton liberty; that in a
  very few weeks after, having performed the business of generation, the same animals should die of
  mere old age, with their wings quite ragged and worn out, their strength exhausted, and all the
  powers of their bodies lost by a total imbecility and weakness, which but a little before enabled
  them to transport themselves through the air with the swiftness of a bird. If, I say, we reflect
  on all these circumstances, we cannot but allow them to be objects of a very extraordinary nature,
  and well adapted for leading the mind to the contemplation of their supreme Author, who has
  thought proper to exhibit to us these kind of insects, thus differing from almost all the animals
  in the creation.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page108">{108}</span></div>

  <p>"They have been variously named by different authors, owing perhaps to the time when they
  wrote, or the progress natural history had made in the world. Some have called them by the name of
  Dragon Fly, others Adder Bolt, Balance Fly, Perla, Libellula or Libella. I shall prefer the last,
  as conveying an idea well known to English adepts. The caterpillars of them all live in ponds and
  stagnant waters (that are undisturbed by cattle) during the greatest part of their lives, and make
  their appearance under three general forms. The first is shewn by Fig. 1. 1.; the second by Fig.
  2.; and the third by Fig. 3. See Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>. As these are the shapes in which
  they all appear, it will not be improper to mention each particularly.</p>

  <p>"The two caterpillars at Fig. 1. 1. Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>, belong only to or produce
  those that sit at rest, with their wings erect, (see Plate <a href="#plate48">48</a>. Fig. 2.),
  and differ from both the others not only in size but in the roundness and slenderness of their
  bodies; at the extremity whereof they are furnished with three tails, each of which upon
  examination being found to be a kind of feather, and is an appendage that neither of the others
  have. Their behaviour also in the water is different from the others, being enabled to twist and
  bend their bodies in a more circular manner. [Subfamily Agrionides.]</p>

  <p>"The second sort of caterpillars, at Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>. Fig. 2. are much shorter
  and thicker in their bodies than either of the others, producing those Libellas with flat bodies,
  as Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>. Fig. 4. and 6. and Plate <a href="#plate48">48</a>. Fig. 1.
  and 5. These are, of all others, the most disagreeable in their appearance; most of them having
  their bodies and legs very rough and shaggy, and of the exact colour of mud. Others appear of a
  dirty green, and very unpleasing hue, a colour that in general reigns among them all; for none can
  boast of any beautiful appearance while in this state, unless the different shapes here exhibited
  can be called so. Indeed the beauty and symmetry, so apparent in their complete states, make ample
  amends for the want of it in this; all of them in general being then very beautiful, discovering
  colours superior to art. [Subfamily, Libellulides. Genus, Libellula.]</p>

  <p>"The caterpillars of the third sort (see Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>. Fig. 3.) are very
  different from the preceding, being the size of the figure, with the abdomen flat at bottom and
  rounding at top, longer and slenderer than those at Fig. 2. but not so much as those at Fig. 1. 1.
  These produce those large Libellas with long slender bodies, who sit at rest with their wings
  expanded, as Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>. Fig. 5. [Subfamily, Libellulides. Genus, Æshna.]</p>

  <p>"Under these three forms are all the caterpillars of Libellas found, there being but little
  difference in the colours or marks of the respective tribes; the various sizes and shapes being
  the chief observable circumstances attending them. They are all furnished with six legs, and have
  each of them four little membranaceous substances issuing from the back, or upper part of the
  thorax, that are the follicles, or cases, wherein the wings are inclosed. When the young
  caterpillars issue from their confinement in the eggs, there is no appearance of these cases, nor
  till a considerable time after; but as they arrive to a maturer state they become more
  conspicuous, and, like the young leaves of trees that open <span class="pagenum"
  id="page109">{109}</span>and expand themselves on the arrival of the spring, their appearance
  increases, till having approached the period when they are to forsake their former habitations and
  become inhabitants of the air, these wing-cases have then arrived to their due size, and carry the
  appearance in which they are here seen. They are all of them, from the largest to the smallest,
  armed with a strong offensive weapon, which serves them, and is indeed the means they are endued
  with, for obtaining their food. This weapon being placed in the under part of the head, just
  beneath the mouth, I have displayed in Fig. 1. and 3. of Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>. where it
  appears just in the same manner as when they are endeavouring to catch their prey. In the largest
  figure at 1. and also in Fig. 2. it appears contracted and shut up, as when at rest. The strength
  and power that these animals discover in the use of this instrument is very singular and
  extraordinary. There are two joints to it, one about the middle, the other underneath the mouth,
  close to the throat; and in some (particularly all those of Fig. 2.) when it is closed or
  contracted, it appears fastened to the face of the creature, by fitting it so exactly as to form a
  perfect mask; covering the mouth, and reaching almost as high as the eyes. In others it is made to
  fit only the under part of the mouth, and when at rest is drawn up close underneath it. At the
  extremity of those that are extended may be observed two very strong and remarkable fangs; that,
  shutting over each other, form a pair of forceps, of such strength that few, if any of their
  captives, can escape if once inclosed therein. [This organ is the greatly developed lower lip of
  the larva, and is analogous in its structure to the same part in the imago.]</p>

  <p>"The motion of these creatures in the water, particularly those of the largest size, is very
  slow; seldom exercising any swiftness or activity, unless they are disturbed and threatened with
  danger, in which case they can transport themselves to places of more security with the quickness
  or agility of a fish; but, in general, they appear to have so little inclination to move, that I
  have often seen them (I mean those that I have kept in glass bowls) remaining in their respective
  places above a week together, and could not discover the least motion in them, unless under the
  circumstance above mentioned, or when they had seen their prey and were advancing to seize it. The
  caterpillars of Fig. 1. 1. and 3. generally fix themselves to some little stick or straw, &amp;c.
  that they find in the water, and there remain, as I said before, without stirring. Those of Fig.
  2. are more frequently seen in motion among the thickest part of the roots and plants that grow
  there, routing and searching for those small animals inhabiting that part, which are their proper
  food. This aversion to motion, so apparent in those of No. 1. and 3., appears to me to be the
  effect of an extraordinary cunning and sagacity; and may be considered as the principal means by
  which they obtain their prey: for while they continue thus motionless in the water, the small
  animals, who constitute their proper food, approach them with less fear than they would otherwise
  do, not suspecting their grand enemy lies upon the watch to seize them the moment they come within
  his reach; but no sooner has their insensibility of danger brought them within a small distance of
  those destructive weapons (mentioned before, being placed under their mouths) but that very
  instant they dart upon them with <span class="pagenum" id="page110">{110}</span>the utmost
  rapidity, suddenly throwing out their forceps, and seizing them with as much eagerness as a pike
  does the unwary gudgeon; they then bring their forceps up to their mouth with their prey in it,
  and feast on their captive prisoner. Nor is their voracious nature less astonishing; and the
  greediness with which the large ones seize other small animals would hardly gain belief among
  persons entirely ignorant of this study. I have seen one of them, in less than an hour's space,
  devour three insects, each of which was full two thirds as big as itself; but, in general, the
  small ones are the sacrifices made by the greater; wherein I must observe, that when they have got
  a caterpillar of the small Libellas in their forceps, such as those of Fig. 1. Plate <a
  href="#plate47">47</a>., they leave no part uneaten, except the three tails, which they let fall
  to the bottom, as perhaps not having substance in them sufficient to afford them proper
  nourishment; for as their food consists altogether of animals less than themselves, they neither
  spare the caterpillars of the lesser Libellæ, nor confine themselves to those belonging to other
  tribes. They will eagerly prey upon the different kinds of Cads, or caterpillars of the Phryganeæ;
  great numbers of whom, at certain seasons, quit those husks or cases they make and swim about,
  with less fear and dread than in the early part of the spring. I have also seen the caterpillars
  of the Notanecta's or Boat-flies devoured by them, and not seldom the small blood-worms, as they
  are called. In short, there are but few of the lesser animals that live in the water, but when
  once they get within the reach of their instruments will certainly fall victims to these
  freshwater Leviathans.</p>

  <p>"I could never observe that these caterpillars ever threw off any exuvia, or skin, in their
  progress from the egg to the complete animal, as most other insects do that live in the open air;
  neither could I ever perceive any difference between the caterpillars and chrysalis's of this
  genus in their outward forms<a id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>: the same voracious
  behaviour in seizing and devouring their prey, reigning both in one and the other; but that they
  internally undergo some material alteration, when passing their respective states, is what I do
  not entertain the least doubt of; as the organs of respiration during the creature's life in the
  water, appear to me to be under a necessity of receiving a great alteration, when they are to
  perform the same office in so different a medium as the air; nor can I suppose this business to be
  done in so quick and sudden a manner, as the short space of time in which the creature would then
  be passing from the caterpillar state to the perfect one would permit, without having the
  intestines prepared, as it were, and fitted by some previous change. However, as this is
  conjecture only, I shall dwell no longer on this head, my present purpose being to point out and
  describe their general circumstances and behaviour.</p>

  <p>"When the caterpillars of the respective species have arrived to their full growth, and nature
  informs them they are to quit their former element of water, for one wherein they are to appear
  invested with very different powers, they prepare for this extraordinary change; and, creeping up
  the sticks, straws, or plants they find for their purpose, whose tops grow out of the water, they
  entirely quit that element, and, stopping at about six or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page111">{111}</span>eight inches above its surface, there fix themselves, and continue some
  time, till their internal form, growing too big to be confined within the skin, that a few minutes
  afterwards will be entirely thrown off, on a sudden, that part of it that covers the thorax,
  splits or bursts on the upper side, and the creature, pushing out its head, next disengages its
  fore legs, which fastening to any substance within its reach, draws gently the remainder of its
  body and legs entirely out, just as a man draws his leg out of a boot, leaving its slough or skin
  sticking in its place, and in the exact form wherein it appeared itself but a few moments before.
  Having thus quitted its former covering, it waits for the wings to expand themselves, and grow to
  their proper size, being before confined within those small cases I mentioned were placed on its
  back. In about half an hour, if the weather is favourable, this extraordinary operation is
  completed; and the wings having arrived to their proper size, the creature generally makes an
  effort to try its strength, well knowing, that if it fails in attempting to fly without being
  endued with a sufficient degree of it, it must certainly fall in that water it lately quitted, and
  there perish; but having made several motions with its wings, and finding its power equal to its
  desire, it suddenly flies into the air, and there fills up a character, as different from the
  former as one element is from the other. At the time this change is accomplishing, the instrument
  or weapon for catching their prey, before mentioned, by an effect of nature, totally disappears,
  and not the least vestige of it then remains; the mouth, indeed, is furnished with jaws, and those
  of a very extraordinary form (dividing themselves both horizontally and perpendicularly), but no
  part of them appear extended beyond the rest, or have the least appearance of being furnished with
  an instrument like what they had in their former state.<a id="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Hitherto I have considered these creatures only in their infant or incomplete states; wherein
  the faculties and powers they are endued with, are entirely different from those of their perfect
  and complete ones. In the former I have described them swimming and grovelling about in the water,
  preying upon the lesser kinds of insects, being incapable of subsisting for any length of time out
  of that element; in the latter we must view them capable of flying in the open air, and conveying
  themselves from place to place. If they are then confined to the limits of a small pond, they are
  now capable of roving from tree to tree, and from field to field, darting and skimming along with
  all the rapidity and seeming joy, that a being sensible of, and exulting in its own powers, can be
  supposed to do; in short, we <span class="pagenum" id="page112">{112}</span>must now view them in
  shapes so distinct and different from their former ones, that they hardly seem to bear any
  relation to each other, except in their nature and appetites; for although they appear in a far
  more elegant dress than when in their caterpillar states, yet these are just the same, the same
  voracious inclinations subsisting now as formerly; hunting after, and preying upon, the lesser
  genera, with the same eagerness and desire as they did when inhabitants of the water. Incredible
  numbers of small moths, bees, flies with four and two wings, are the daily sacrifices offered to
  the insatiable appetites of these hungry gluttons; and where they devoured one insect in the water
  they now destroy a hundred, if the mildness of the season will permit them to range about in quest
  of them. In rainy weather they seldom or ever move, nor when the wind is very strong and
  boisterous. Indeed, it is not to be wondered at. The small insects, who are their proper food,
  being by the same reasons prevented from being abroad, consequently are an impediment to those
  motives, that so strongly induce the Libellas to fly about. During such inclement times they
  generally shelter themselves from the wind, &amp;c. being suspended by their feet in a
  perpendicular position on some twig, that is remote and separate from any boughs, waiting in that
  manner, without motion, for better weather and sunshine.</p>

  <p>"I am strongly inclined to believe, that the greater part, if not all the Libellas, are two
  years in passing from the egg to the complete animal. But as this is a circumstance I do not
  remember to have seen in any author, I shall not attempt to establish my opinion as an absolute
  truth. I shall mention my reasons for this belief, and leave it to every person either to confirm
  or confute it, as his observations shall hereafter give him an opportunity.</p>

  <p>"In order to do this, it would be necessary I should mention the times when each species first
  makes its appearance here in England. But as this would not only take up too much of the reader's
  time, (there being at least twenty-two of them) but it would likewise be impossible to be
  understood by any, but the experienced adept, unless I gave figures of them all; I shall therefore
  content myself with observing, that the Libella figured in Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>. Fig.
  5. though found in America, about New York, &amp;c. is nearly the same with our English one,
  differing but a very little from it, and which I have inserted chiefly as an instance to
  illustrate this subject. Ours is the last species but one, that comes forth in the summer,
  breeding only once a year, appearing about the 2nd of August. Therefore, to elucidate this point,
  suppose we allow a fortnight or three weeks from that time for all the Libellas of this species to
  make their appearance in, that nature intended should be bred that year; but in order to set this
  matter in the strongest light, I shall allow a month to that purpose. If, therefore, the Libellas
  were only one year in passing from the egg to the perfect state, we might justly conclude, that
  after the 2nd of September, (a month from the time of their first appearing) all of this species
  would have arrived to their complete states; and that none of their caterpillars could be found in
  the waters after that time, by reason they had all quitted that element, and were become flying
  insects. This, I say, is the conclusion we might fairly, and without presuming on the matter,
  make. But this is <span class="pagenum" id="page113">{113}</span>very far from being the case. For
  let any one examine stagnant waters at any time during the months of August, September, or
  October, and from thence in any part of the following winter, and he will find these very
  caterpillars at any of those times: and this, not in any one particular year, but they will be
  found also in any one whatever, fully fed, and of the largest size. Nor are the caterpillars of
  this species the only ones to be found fully fed. Those of N<sup>o</sup>. 2. belonging to the
  flat-bodied Libella, will also be found very plentifully, many of them being of the first
  magnitude, together with numbers of the same species, very young according to the time of year
  when sought for; and appearing to have been hatched from those eggs that were laid by parent
  insects in the spring; for such I must conclude them to be, how else can we account for their
  smallness, at the same time that we may find others of the largest size? We must not suppose there
  can be this difference of size in the same species, owing to some eggs having been laid three
  weeks or a month sooner than others; that, being so short a space of time as not to allow it
  possible for one of those caterpillars to attain its full size, (and all the species of
  flat-bodied Libellas appear within a month of each other.) Nor can we be so deceived as to mistake
  a species of the long-bodied caterpillars, for one of the short-bodied; the difference being
  extremely apparent at the first glance.</p>

  <p>"These reasons appear to me so convincing, I should have thought myself inexcuseable to have
  passed them over in silence, when I was giving the history of these animals. I shall therefore
  think myself happy to have this circumstance corroborated by future experience, or rectified and
  cleared up, if found to be an error. I shall only say, I have dwelt the longer on it, as it is an
  observation I never heard of before. I have likewise singled out the largest Libella, and the
  flat-bodied ones for its illustration, as being more conspicuous by their size, and easier to be
  observed than those of the smaller sorts.</p>

  <p>"The two principles of hunger and lust, so apparent through the animal kingdom, are in no class
  or tribe more manifest and visible than in these insects. The former I have described and
  explained through their different states; it remains for me to shew the manner in which they obey
  the calls of the latter. And herein I must observe, that the different manner in which the act of
  copulation is performed, depends on the difference of the respective kinds; the organs of
  generation being placed in different parts of the body, according to the distinct species. All the
  flat-bodied ones have those parts placed in common with most other insects, at the extremity of
  the tail. In all the slender-bodied ones, the organ of the male is placed next the breast, close
  to the part where the thorax and abdomen unite; while the same organ in the female lies in the
  very extremity of the tail, and the singular manner of these creatures coupling is a circumstance
  worthy of observation.</p>

  <p>"As soon as they have arrived to their perfect state, the males seek out their mates, in order
  to propagate their species; for this purpose they frequent ponds and standing waters, places where
  the females generally harbour, and when the male in the course of his flight comes within a
  certain distance of her, if it be one of that species whose sexual parts <span class="pagenum"
  id="page114">{114}</span>in both sexes are placed in the tail, he immediately flies to her, and
  fixing himself by his feet to the hinder part of her abdomen, bends his body round her tail, and
  performs the business of generation, both flying about all the time this act is performing; the
  whole transaction not exceeding the space of half a minute. Within a few hours after, the female,
  thus impregnated, begins to lay her eggs in the following manner. She singles out a leaf, grass,
  or some such matter, that is floating just below the surface of the water, in some pond, and,
  hovering in the air about a foot above this spot, on a sudden she descends, and dips the extremity
  of her tail in the water, at which instant she discharges an egg, that at the moment of its
  emission is inveloped in a glutinous liquid, sufficiently tenacious to enable it to adhere firmly
  on the floating substance above-mentioned without sinking. In this manner she continues depositing
  them till she has discharged the proper quantity, hovering in the air all the time, and emitting
  them as fast as the pendulum of a clock performs its vibrations; placing them close to one another
  in no regular or exact order. Whether she discharges at one time all her quantity of eggs, or only
  those that were fecundated and ready for emission, waiting to have the remaining eggs within her
  again fecundated by the male, or whether the first act of copulation sufficiently impregnates the
  whole quantity which she discharges at different times, as nature ripens them, is a circumstance I
  cannot determine. However this may be, it is certain she does not discharge them all at once; but
  comes again to the same place, when those within her are ready for emission, and there lays them
  in the same manner as at first.</p>

  <p>"In this manner all the flat-bodied Libellas copulate and lay their eggs; the others, which are
  formed with slender bodies, behave very differently in every circumstance; for in each of those
  species, when the male has singled out its mate, he flies to her, and by means of two little bony
  substances placed at the end of his tail, issuing on each side, and composing a kind of forceps,
  he fixes himself to the forepart of her neck, close behind the head, the female discovering no
  sign of fear while he is performing this action; having fixed himself in this position, he remains
  there several days, sometimes appearing with his body quite erect, at other times bending himself,
  and settling with his legs on the same substance she may happen to alight on, without ever
  quitting his hold; but flies through the air, thus united, wherever the fancy or inclination of
  the female disposes her to go. This behaviour we must consider as a prelude to copulation, for
  that is not performed till a considerable time after they are thus united; and therefore I look on
  it as a wooing, or act of courtship in the male. But having remained a sufficient time in this
  manner, that is, till the female is disposed to receive him, she bends her tail round to that part
  where I described the organ of generation to be placed in the male, and, being still held fast by
  the neck, in that attitude they perform the mandate of nature. This action being over, that in the
  smaller kinds takes up a considerable space of time (for I have known them in this posture above
  eighteen hours) the female soon after begins to lay her eggs. She flies to some rush, reed, or
  other plant growing in the water, and settling close to its edge dips <span class="pagenum"
  id="page115">{115}</span>the end of her tail a little below the surface, and fixes her eggs to the
  rush or substance she is settled on; which, by means of the glutinous matter all eggs of this kind
  are surrounded with, adheres sufficiently fast, and there remains till the heat of the sun has
  brought the young animal into life; which immediately on quitting its confinement sinks to the
  bottom, or repairs to the place where nature directs it to seek out its food.</p>

  <p>"In this manner all the slender-bodied tribe behave, differing only in some particular
  circumstances; as, for instance, the largest Libellas, as that at Fig. 5. Pl. <a
  href="#plate47">47</a>. are not near so long in copulating or wooing as the small ones; for by the
  former this act is performed in a very short space, and while they are flying about in the air.
  Others, of a smaller size, are less quick in this performance; and as we descend to the smallest
  species, we shall find they take by much the longest time; observing, by the way, that all these
  slender-bodied ones lay their eggs in the same manner, that is, by fixing them to some substance
  to which they adhere, till they are ripened into life. My experience well informing me they never
  scatter them in any loose careless manner as some insects do, but are placed in such proper and
  apt situations as to receive the influence of the sun to bring them to maturity.</p>

  <p>"If we attentively consider these creatures, either in their caterpillar or complete states, we
  cannot help concluding them to be a rank of beings of greater benefit and advantage to mankind
  than they appear to be at first view; for, not to mention their being annual 'ministers of
  nature,' they are appointed by the great Governor of the universe as grand instruments for
  assisting to preserve that equilibrium so apparently reigning through the insect world, and which
  all who have made any progress in the study of natural history unanimously confess. Hence the
  voracious disposition of the Libellas is wisely made to answer a most necessary and beneficial
  purpose; and the great numbers of small insects which are daily sacrificed to their insatiable
  appetites, both in their caterpillar as well as complete states, is as strong an instance as any I
  know of the necessity and propriety of the existence of these animals. The general principle
  reigning through the whole animal kingdom, of the stronger preying upon the weak and defenceless,
  can hardly be explained to the purpose of being useful to mankind, and agreeable to the laws of
  nature, in any one instance more than is evidently to be observed in the subjects I have been
  describing. The least reflection will confirm this; for if the food of the Libellas when in their
  complete forms had consisted of the leaves of plants, like the locust genus, and not of those
  small insects they now prey on; or had it, like the beetle tribe, consisted of the superfluous
  parts of nature, as the putrid carcases of dead animals, rotten wood, &amp;c. how great a chasm
  would there have been in the universal chain? how evident and conspicuous would it have appeared?
  and how could the vast number of small insects, increasing every day during the summer, be
  restrained and lessened? what genus of the transparent-winged class could possibly have performed
  this business singly? or could all the genera of flies, and even birds that we know of, have
  accomplished this end? could all the Dipteræ, or any other <span class="pagenum"
  id="page116">{116}</span>kinds that prey on the lesser genera, have prevented such an increase of
  them as to become in a little time a plague too great to be borne? No. The Almighty Creator has
  most wisely constituted this genus for executing His commands in the manner I have described; and
  for this reason they must be considered as beings of greater consequence than the inconsiderate
  part of mankind allow them to be.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"Nor is this the only advantage arising from their existence. The still waters,
  where these creatures are inhabitants during their infant state, are in some degree by their
  assistance preserved sweet and good, that otherwise might corrupt and putrify, for the motion the
  waters receive by these insects is not trifling; the respiration they perform in that element
  being observable by a close attention, which, together with that and the motion of thousands of
  other insects, does in some measure contribute to keep it sweet and wholesome."</p>

    green, and on the upper part gibbous; having on each side three swellings, each of which
    terminates in three short and thick spines. Tegmina darkish green, with a great number of small
    black spots on them of different shapes. Wings scarlet, spotted with black; the spots being
    larger than those of the wing-cases, and of different shapes. Abdomen green, with several yellow
    rings surrounding it, and about the same length as the tegmina. Legs green; the thighs being

  <p>Our author states, that he was informed by a gentleman who lived several years at Sierra Leone,
  and by whom this species was communicated to him, that "they appear about the end of June, and
  soon afterwards retire among the branches of the palm trees, where they reside till the violent
  rains compel them to quit that situation, and live among the plants, &amp;c. on the ground." In
  the Introduction to the third volume, he however states on the authority of Mr. Smeathman, that
  "this beautiful locust is an inhabitant of the sandy plains, called Savannas, which indeed abound
  with palms; but my friend is in doubt whether they have any kind of predilection for those
  trees.</p>

  <p>"'Although the hot climates abound in every part with insects of the locust and cicada kinds,
  insomuch that their chirping, particularly that of the cicadas, becomes in some instances
  intolerable; yet in the sandy plains before mentioned, which are thinly covered with grass, their
  numbers are immensely greater, and of various kinds, sizes, and colours, skipping or flirting
  about in all directions at every step of the traveller.' Perhaps, indeed, their kinds may not be
  so various as one would at first imagine, the same insect differing so much from itself in the
  various periods of its life. From the fact however here mentioned, it seems most certain that
  these insects breed under ground in Africa, as well as in these climates, according to Linnæus and
  other entomologists."</p>

  <p>From the knowledge which we possess at the present time relative to the economy of this tribe
  of insects, it is necessary to observe, upon the last above-quoted passage, that the term
  "breeding under ground," must be restricted to the mere circumstance of the eggs being buried
  beneath the surface of the earth, because the insects in all their active stages (including that
  of the pupa) feed upon grass and other vegetable substances above ground.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In following up the very proper plan proposed and partially effected by Mr. Kirby,
  in the Zoological Journal, of restoring to the primary divisions of the Linnæan genus Gryllus the
  names which he gave to them, and which have been so confusedly employed by Fabricius and the
  French entomologists, and of which I have elsewhere given a more complete explanation, it is
  necessary that the generic name Locusta should be restored to the true migratory locusts composing
  the genus Acrydium of Latreille, and that a new name (Rutidoderes) should be given to the subgenus
  Acrydium of Serville, comprising the present and other allied species.</p>

    of different shapes; those next the shoulders being nearly black, and those toward the extremity
    more transparent. Wings very thin, and more transparent than the tegmina, being of a greenish

    and on the upper ridge is black. Legs pale brown. Hinder thighs almost square, the outer sides
    being white and prettily chequered, which, when viewed by a magnifier, seem like scales laid

  that I have given the reference to Linnæus with doubt, although Fabricius cites Drury's figure

    downwards; terminating at top in a spine, with a small membrane on each side. Antennæ short, and
    thread-like; about the length of the head. Thorax very slender, flat at bottom, rounded at top,
    and grooved on the sides; being about the length of the abdomen, exactly representing a twig of
    a tree, being furnished on each side next the head with a thin yellow membrane of an angulated
    shape. Tegmina yellow, about two-thirds the length of the abdomen; the edges are margined, and
    the principal tendons by which they are united to the body extend like the rib of a leaf from
    the base to the extremity; several other smaller ribs or tendons branching out from the first,
    make them the exact figures of the leaves of trees. Wings green and transparent, except on the
    anterior edges, and rather shorter than the tegmina. Abdomen yellow, broad towards the
    extremity, but where it joins the thorax it is narrow, terminating at the anus in a short point;
    having two smaller ones above it on the last segment but one. Middle and hind legs greyish
    brown, and shaped exactly like the twig of a tree; the former being furnished at the tips of the
    tibiæ with three small spines, and the latter with two; each of the femora has a single spine to
    it, and close thereto are placed three membranes; two on the fore part, smaller than that
    behind, which is circular and remarkably thin. Fore legs yellow, with brown spots or clouds on
    them. Trochanters flat and thin, and ending in a short strong spine, a little crooked. Femora
    broad, and on the outer side thick and hollow, with two rows of spines; but on the inner side
    very thin and smooth. Tibiæ joining to the shins, long and triangular; the under side being
    hollow, and furnished with two rows of <span class="pagenum" id="page123">{123}</span>small
    teeth like hairs; the extremity terminating in a long sharp spine, from whence issue the tarsi.

    <p class="sp0">This insect resembles a parcel of straws united together, being entirely
    wingless, and is indeed, but incorrectly, stated by Drury to be the larva of an insect like that
    at Fig. 1. Its general colour, as he was informed, is green; but having received it in spirits,
    it had become of a dusky brown colour. Head small and long, reaching almost to the fore legs.
    Eyes round and black. Antennæ like hairs; being as long as the insect itself. Body, which
    extends from where the hinder legs are placed, consisting of nine segments, almost as long as
    the remaining part of the insect; those legs being fixed nearly in the middle, at a small
    distance from whence are placed the middle legs.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This insect belongs to a singular and numerous family, known to collectors by the names of
  Spectres, or Walking-stick insects; and others, Walking-leaves, from the strong resemblance which
  they exhibit to pieces of dried sticks and detached leaves.</p>

  <p>The insect here figured appears to be in an immature state, and would probably in its final
  state have acquired wings. Our author appears to have been aware of this, but he incorrectly
  describes it as the caterpillar of an insect like that at Fig. 1.</p>

    <p>The original title of this work, Vol. I., was "Illustrations of Natural History, wherein are
    exhibited upwards of two hundred and forty figures of <span class="sc">Exotic Insects</span>,
    according to their different genera, very few of which have hitherto been figured by any author,
    being engraved and coloured from nature, with the greatest accuracy, and under the author's own
    inspection; on fifty copper-plates; with a particular description of each Insect, interspersed
    with remarks and reflections on the nature and properties of many of them, by D. Drury, 1770."
    The second volume containing upwards of two hundred and twenty figures, on fifty copper-plates,
    appeared in 1773; and the third containing upwards of two hundred figures, also on fifty plates,
    was not published until 1782. The majority of the plates were drawn and engraved by the
    celebrated Moses Harris, but some of the plates in the last volume were by a different hand.</p>

    <p>There is a species of ants in Africa, exceedingly numerous, and continually ranging from
    place to place; not dwelling in colonies or hills, as we see them in England; being armed with
    strong jaws or forceps, and whatever animal they assail in the course of their travels, they
    generally by means of their numbers overcome; there being no method of securing themselves, or
    preserving their lives, but by running into the water. The blacks, as I have been informed by
    gentlemen who have lived there, will get out of their way, or quit their habitations, taking
    their children, &amp;c. with them, and wait till the ants have passed them. So numerous is this
    host, that a deer, hog, &amp;c. being killed and left on the ground, in one night will have the
    flesh entirely cleared from the bones, and made a complete skeleton.</p>

    <p>If any person is inclinable to make this trial, I must advise him to collect them in the
    spring, when they abound with this liquor, and to choose only the females, whose bodies at that
    season are so large, being as it were overcharged with oil and a great number of eggs, that they
    seem with difficulty to drag them along. When they have discharged their eggs, they appear much
    less, and are not furnished with that oil they before abounded with. The males have little, if
    any of it, therefore are not proper for the purpose. This insect is of a blue colour, and found
    in the fields during the months of April and May, in the state I have mentioned; the blue colour
    is not shining and beautiful as that on the belly and legs of the blue dung beetle, but of a
    fine mazarine blue, without that polish. It is about an inch and half long (the males are
    shorter), the head and thorax about five-eighths of an inch, being very small and slender for
    the size of the insect.</p>

    <p>There is no branch of natural history where the existence of a <i>Lusus Naturæ</i> is so
    plain and observable as in this, particularly among the insects brought from warm climates;
    where the wantonness and luxuriance of nature is so great; that its laws, strict and regular as
    they are, through the rest of the animal creation, almost seem to be invaded and broke in upon.
    Instances, also, are frequent in this study, of a cluster of eggs being discharged by a female,
    the insects springing from which, have differed in the circumstances above-mentioned so very
    greatly, as in some cases to be mistaken for different species.</p>

    <p>The name of this African species has not been recorded. The following additional observations
    by Mr. Smeathman will be serviceable in enabling us to obtain an idea of the treasures which,
    even yet, European entomologists may expect to receive from this but little investigated quarter
    of the globe. "The whole country of Africa, within the tropics, is one immense forest, except
    where the sandy plains are too unsettled to afford a proper footing for vegetation. Wherever any
    inhabitants settle, they make plantations by cutting down the woods and burning them to
    fertilize the ground, and never sow two years together on the same spot, but let the trees grow
    up again for two or three years, by way of fallow, before they attempt to get another crop from
    it. It is these spots, which Smeathman calls recent plantations, which afford the greatest
    variety of insects and the easiest obtained. In the second and third year they become impassable
    to human feet."</p>

    <p>Sir J. E. Smith states that the Linnæan cabinet does not contain a specimen of this insect,
    nor of the Ilioneus of "the Insects of Georgia," pl. 2, one of the figures of which was
    considered by Mr. Jones, the celebrated lepidopterist, to be the Linnæan Troilus. Nevertheless,
    on the authority of the Banksian cabinet labelled (from recollection alone) by Fabricius, Sir J.
    E. Smith gave the Asterias under the name of Troilus, and the true Troilus as a new species.</p>

    <p>Since this was written, I have been favoured by Mr. MacLeay with an inspection of his
    magnificent collection, which possesses a Goliathus, nearly resembling the insect here figured,
    and which that gentleman considers as a variety of this. It is, however, considerably smaller,
    and the horns of the head are not so much developed.</p>

    public. Far from it. Every adept knows it, and to every adept I would appeal.</p>
    <p>"I have counted above three hundred eggs, contained in the bag of a spider; and I have
    observed more than that number laid by a water insect (Phryganea) on a blade of grass, by a
    river side. The moth, common in our gardens, named the <i>Great Tiger</i> (or Caja of Linnæus),
    lays above six hundred eggs; and almost double that number I have known discharged by a <i>Long
    Legs</i>, as it is called, or Tipula of Linnæus. Goedartius mentions two thousand worms that he

    <p>From our information respecting the habits of the indigenous and European species of

    pretty certain it is in their power to retard this regeneration considerably, if I can judge
    from concurrent circumstances attending those I have kept in glass bowls, on purpose to observe
    their nature and behaviour. In one of these I have seen two libella-caterpillars, that were
    fully grown, for three days successively creep up the straws out of the water, in order to
    undergo their transformation; but finding themselves deprived of the sun-shine, (a circumstance
    generally attending this performance,) or at least that agreeable warmth of air so necessary for
    their purpose, they retired into the water: in an hour's time they made another essay, but
    finding the same circumstances subsisting as before, they again retired under water, and this
    they continued doing for three mornings; till at length one of them, wearied out by those
    frequent efforts, the period of nature not being to be totally avoided or suppressed, although
    it might be retarded, perished in the water, being at length so weak as to be unable to creep
    above its surface. The other, on removing the vessel into the sunshine, yielded its proper
    insect."</p>
